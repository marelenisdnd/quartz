Unknown forces drove gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots. Gnomes are often driven by passions and desires that non-gnomes see as eccentric at best, and nonsensical at worst. A gnome may risk his life to taste the food at a giant’s table, to reach the bottom of a pit just because it would be the lowest place he’s ever been, or to tell jokes to a dragon—and to the gnome those goals are as worthy as researching a new spell, gaining vast wealth, or putting down a powerful evil force. While such apparently fickle and impulsive acts are not universal among gnomes, they are common enough for the cultures as a whole to have earned a reputation for being impetuous and at least a little mad. Gnomes are often amazed how alike other common, civilized cultures are. It seems stranger to a gnome that humans and elves share so many similarities than that the gnomes do not. Indeed, gnomes often confound their allies by treating everyone who is not a gnome as part of a single, vast non-gnome collective.</p><a href=#physical-description><h3 id=physical-description><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h3></a><p>Gnomes generally stand just over three feet in height. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes larger than themselves. The coloration of gnomes varies so wildly that many outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly not above cosmetic enhancement, their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes’ coloration has little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome’s parents having no apparent bearing on the gnome’s appearance. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and their proportions often don’t match the norm of other humanoids. Many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their features, but outsiders often fixate on a gnome’s most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the focus of insults or endearments.</p><a href=#society><h3 id=society><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>SOCIETY</h3></a><p>Gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other ancestries. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a “gnome quarter,” and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them. Whimsical creatures at heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring relationships, instead pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that borders on zealotry. If a gnome does settle in an area or stay with a group for a longer period, it is almost always the result of some benefit that area gives to a vocation or obsession to which the gnome had dedicated himself. Despite their varied backgrounds and lack of a unifying homeland, gnomes do possess some common cultural traits. Males have a strange fondness for unusual hats and headgear, often wearing the most expensive and ostentatious head-covering they can afford. Females rarely cover their heads, but proudly wear elaborate and eccentric hairstyles that often include jeweled combs and headpieces.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> Gnomes have difficulty interacting with others, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways the very fact other cultures see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. The inability or unwillingness of members of other cultures to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes. In many ways, it is gnomes’ strong connection to a wide range of apparently unconnected ideas that makes it difficult for other races to build relationships with them. Gnome humor, for example, is often focused on physical pranks, nonsensical rhyming nicknames, and efforts to convince others of outrageous lies that strain all credibility. Gnomes find such efforts hysterically funny, but their pranks often come across as malicious or senseless to other races, while gnomes in turn tend to think of the taller races as dull and lumbering giants. Gnomes get along reasonably well with halflings and humans, who at least have some traditions of bizarre, gnomelike humor. Gnomes generally feel dwarves and half-orcs need to lighten up, and attempt to bring levity into their lives with tricks, jokes, and outrageous tales the more dour races simply cannot see the sense of. Gnomes respect elves, but often grow frustrated with the slow pace at which members of the long-lived race make decisions. To gnomes, action is always better than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest periods.</p><a href=#adventurers><h3 id=adventurers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ADVENTURERS</h3></a><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common, Gnome, and Sylvan.
<strong>Age Range:</strong> Adult 45, old age 150, max age 200-500.
<strong>Gnome Males:</strong> Height 3'2-3'8 and weight 37-43 (Average 3'5" , 40 lbs).
<strong>Gnome Females:</strong> Height 3&rsquo;-3'6" and weight 32-38 (Average 3'3", 35 lbs).</p><ul><li><p><strong>GNOME MAGIC:</strong> Gnomes can cast cantrips (see page 171) as if they knew each of the following powers: light, sound, telekinesis, and beast friend using their Smarts (or arcane skill if they have one). They have 1 Power Point for activating these cantrips, regained as usual (see page 169). Gnomes with an Arcane Background or Mystic Power add their bonus Power Point to their pool but must still learn the spells if they wish to cast them normally.</p></li><li><p><strong>KEEN SENSES:</strong> Gnomes start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Notice to d12 + 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>LOW LIGHT VISION:</strong> Gnome eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.</p></li><li><p><strong>OBSESSIVE:</strong> Gnomes start with a d4 in any one Smarts-related skill.</p></li><li><p><strong>REDUCED PACE:</strong> Decrease the character’s Pace by 1 and reduce the running die by one die type.</p></li><li><p><strong>SIZE −1:</strong> Averaging roughly three and a half feet tall, gnomes reduce their Size and Toughness by 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>TOUGH:</strong> Gnomes are surprisingly hardy despite their size and strength. They start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. This increases maximum Vigor to d12 + 1.</p></li></ul><a href=#alternate-ancestral-abilities><h4 id=alternate-ancestral-abilities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES</h4></a><ul><li><p>ETERNAL HOPE: Gnomes rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Gnomes with this ability add +1 to their Fear checks. This replaces Keen Senses.</p></li><li><p>GIFT OF TONGUES: Gnomes love languages and learning about those they meet. Gnomes with this ability know two additional languages of their choice. This replaces Obsessive.</p></li><li><p>WARDEN OF NATURE: Gnomes must often protect their homes against unnatural or pestilential infestations. These gnomes gain +1 Parry against Aberrations, Oozes, and Vermin because of their special training.
