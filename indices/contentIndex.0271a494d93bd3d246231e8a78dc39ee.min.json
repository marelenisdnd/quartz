Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.34321006Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

[Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have Docker installed already, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nNow that you are happy with how your Quartz instance looks, let's get it hosted!\n\n\u003e üåç Step 5: [Hosting Quartz online!](notes/hosting.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. \n\nMost societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always the one you least suspect‚Äù is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nAasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos. \n\n### SOCIETY \nAasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. \n\nWhile corrupt aasimars may be loners or establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders. \n\n**Relations:** It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than in those of a different heritage, though it may be that humanity‚Äôs inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars. Perhaps the endemic traits of other ancestries are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances non-humans may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true. Even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable.\n\nThey get on well with half-elves, who share a similar not-quitehuman marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with half-orcs, who have no patience for aasimars‚Äô overly pretty words and faces. Elven courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known ancestries, gnomes find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage. \n\n**Religion:** For the most part, aasimars favor deities of honor, valor, protection, healing, and refuge, or simple and prosaic faiths of home, community, and family. Some also follow the paths of art, music, and lore, finding truth and wisdom in beauty and learning. \n![[Aasimar 2.png|right|200]]\n### ADVENTURERS \nAasimars frequently become adventurers, as they often don't quite feel at home in human society and feel the pull of some greater destiny. \n\n**Languages:** Common, Celestial. \n\n - **DARKVISION:** Aasimar eyes are able to pierce the darkness. They ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10‚Äù (20 yards). \n\n - **DIPLOMATIC:** Aasimar start with a d6 in Persuasion instead of d4. This increases maximum Persuasion to d12 + 1. \n\n - **DAYLIGHT:** Summoning celestial light, aasimar can illuminate an area. Once per day, as a limited free action, the aasimar cast minor light as an Innate Power. \n\n - **NATIVE OUTSIDER:** An aasimar's Type is Outsider rather than Humanoid. \n\n - **SPIRITED:** Aasimar are strong willed and insightful. They start with a d6 in Spirit instead of a d4. This increases maximum Spirit to d12 + 1. \n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES \n\n - **CELESTIAL CRUSADER:** Some aasimars follow their destiny to war against the powers of ultimate evil. These individuals gain Favored Enemy (Outsider) as per the Ranger Class Edge in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds. This replaces Diplomatic. \n\n - **EXALTED RESISTANCE:** An aasimar with this ability gains the Arcane Resistance Edge even if she does not meet the Requirements. This replaces Spirited. \n\n - **HALO:** Some aasimar possess the unique ability to manifest halos. These aasimar's Daylight ability creates a halo shaped light centered on their heads. When the halo is manifested, the aasimar gains a free reroll on Tests against evil creatures. This replaces Darkvision.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Catfolk":{"title":"","content":"# CATFOLK\n![[Catfolk.png|right|200]] \nCatfolk are natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such efforts are not limited to the search for distant lands. Many catfolk see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. Catfolk are curious by nature, and their culture never discourages inquisitiveness, but rather fosters and encourages it. Outsiders see them as quirky extroverts, but within catfolk tribes there is no shame attached to minor peculiarities, eccentricities, or foolhardiness. All but the most inwardly focused catfolk enjoy being the center of attention, but not at the expense of their tribe, whether it‚Äôs the one the catfolk are born into or the tribe they choose through the bonds of friendship. Catfolk tend to be both generous and loyal to their family and friends. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nCatfolk are lithe and slender, standing between dwarves and humans in stature. While clearly humanoid, they possess many feline features, including a coat of soft fine fur, slit pupils, catlike ears, and a sleek, slender tail. Their fingers terminate in small, sharp, retractable claws, though they are typically not powerful enough to be used as weapons. Some members of the species‚Äîeither by quirk of birth or from years of honing‚Äîcan use them with deadly effect. Feline whiskers are not uncommon, and hair and eye color vary greatly. \n\n### SOCIETY \nWhile self-expression is an important aspect of catfolk culture, it is mitigated by a strong sense of community and group effort. The pursuit of personal power never comes before the health and wellbeing of the tribe. More than one enemy has underestimated this seemingly gentle people only to discover much too late that their cohesion also provides them great strength. Catfolk prefer to be led by their most competent members, usually a council of sub-chieftains chosen through consensus or election. The sub-chiefs then choose a chieftain to lead in times of danger and to mediate disputes among the sub-chiefs. The chieftain is the most capable member of the tribe, and is often magically talented. Catfolk who settle in more urban and civilized areas still cling to a similar tribal structure, but often see friends outside the tribe, even noncatfolk, as part of their extended tribe. Within adventuring groups, catfolk who do not consider themselves the obvious choice as chieftain often defer to the person who most resembles their cultural ideal of a chieftain. \n\n**Relations:** Adaptable and curious, catfolk get along with almost any ancestry that extends reciprocal goodwill. They acclimate easily to halflings, humans, and especially elves. Catfolk and elves share a passionate nature, as well as a love of music, dance, and storytelling; elven communities often mentor catfolk tribes, though such elves are careful not to act in a patronizing manner toward their feline friends. Gnomes make natural companions for catfolk, as catfolk enjoy their strange and obsessive qualities. Catfolk are tolerant of kobolds as long as the reptilian beings respect the catfolk‚Äôs boundaries. The feral nature of orcs stirs as much puzzlement as it does revulsion among catfolk, as they don‚Äôt understand orcs‚Äô savagery and propensity for self-destruction. Half-orcs, on the other hand, intrigue catfolk, especially those half-orcs who strive to excel beyond the deleterious and hateful nature of their savage kin. \n\n**Religion:** The gods Desna, Cayden Cailean, and Shelyn all speak to the souls of catfolk, and many tribes depict the latter two as catfolk themselves. The quest for self-improvement has led many an individual to explore different philosophies, including the worship of Irori. \n\n### ADVENTURERS \nNatural born trackers, the hunter-gatherer aspect of their tribes pushes many catfolk toward occupations as rangers and guides, but such roles don‚Äôt always speak to their love of performance art, be it song, dance, or storytelling. Catfolk legends also speak of a rich tradition of great sorcerers. Those catfolk who internalize their wanderlust often become wizards and monks. Catfolk understand that exploration and self-knowledge can lead down many roads, and are accepting of nearly all professions and ways of life. \n\n**Languages:** Common, Catfolk. \n\n - **AGILE:** Catfolk are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. \n\n - **CAT'S LUCK:** Catfolk get a free reroll on failed Evasion rolls. \n\n - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Like other feline creatures, catfolk can see perfectly in low light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination. \n\n - **SPRINTER:** Catfolk increase their running die by one die type. \n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES \n - **CAT‚ÄôS CLAWS:** Feral catfolk have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their species. Catfolk with this ability have a pair of claws that deal Str+d4 damage (see Natural Weapons in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). This replaces Agile. \n\n - **NIMBLE FALLER:** Some catfolk have an amazing sense of balance and keen knowledge of their own center of gravity. Catfolk with this ability land on their feet even when they take damage from a fall. Furthermore, catfolk with this ability reduce falling damage by 1d6 + 1. This replaces Sprinter. \n\n - **SCENT:** These catfolk favor a keen sense of smell over sensitive sight. Catfolk with this ability ignore up to 4 points of penalties when attacking foes hidden by magical darkness, invisibility or similar abilities. This replaces Low Light Vision.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Dhampir":{"title":"","content":"# DHAMPIRS \nThe half-living children of vampires and human females, dhampirs are progenies of tragedy. The circumstances of a dhampir‚Äôs conception are often called into question but scarcely understood, as few mothers survive the childbirth. Those who do often abandon their children and refuse to speak of the matter. While some speculate dhampirs result when mortals couple with vampires, others claim they form when a pregnant woman suffers a vampire bite. Some particularly zealous scholars even contest dhampirs‚Äô status as a unique ancestry, instead viewing them as humans suffering from an unholy affliction. Indeed, this hypothesis is strengthened by dhampirs‚Äô seeming inability to reproduce; their offspring are inevitably humans. Regardless, they live and die just like any other mortal creatures, despite possessing a supernatural longevity akin to that of elves. Hardship and suffering fill a dhampir‚Äôs formative years. Most grow up as orphans, and despite their exquisite features, they face a lifetime of prejudice, mistrust, fear, and persecution. Humans who witness the nature of a dhampir child‚Äôs supernatural powers or sensitivity to daylight display an array of reactions ranging from awe to terror to outright hatred. Eventually, a dhampir must learn to cope with these difficulties and find his place in the world. Dhampirs keep few, if any, close companions. Even with those they feel attached to, most dhampirs are sullen and reserved. Some fear the persecution heaped upon them may be transferred to their companions, whereas others worry their own bloodlust will one day overwhelm them and they‚Äôll inadvertently turn upon their friends. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nTall and slender and with well-defined musculature, dhampirs look like statuesque humans of unearthly beauty. Their hair, eye, and skin colors resemble unnerving versions of their mothers‚Äô; many possess a ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the color of a bruise. While many dhampirs can pass as humans, their features are inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All dhampirs have elongated incisors. While not true fangs, these teeth are sharp enough to draw blood, and many suffer a desire to indulge in sanguinary delights, despite the fact that it provides no physical benefit. \n\n### SOCIETY \nDhampirs have no culture of their own, nor do they have any known lands or even communities. Often born in secret and abandoned at orphanages or left to die, they tend to live solitary lives. Individuals acquire the cultural beliefs and teachings of the regions in which they grow up, and adopt additional philosophies over the course of their lives. This ability to adapt to a variety of circumstances provides dhampirs with a social camouflage that hides them from both predators and prey. \n\n**Relations:** As dhampirs are scions of evil, few outsiders view them favorably. They share an affinity for those half-breeds whose ancestry also sets them apart from human society, particularly tieflings and half-orcs. Humans view them with a combination of fear and pity, though such feelings often devolve into hatred and violence. Others, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, simply shun them. \n\n**Religion:** Dhampirs who become vampire hunters tend to worship Sarenrae or Pharasma, depending on their moral stance. Those who have spiraled into evil and embraced their undead heritage typically worship the demon lord Zura the Vampire Queen or Urgathoa, goddess of the undead. \n\n### ADVENTURERS \nThe life of an adventurer comes naturally to most dhampirs, since constant persecution condemns many to spend their days wandering. Regardless of their reasons, most dhampirs simply feel more at home on the road than in a settlement. Almost universally, those inclined toward magic pursue the field of necromancy, though dhampir alchemists have been known to obsess over transforming their own bodies with potions and mutagens. \n\n**Languages:** Common. \n\n - **AGILE:** Dhampirs are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. \n\n - **DETECT UNDEAD:** As a limited action, a dhampir can sense undead within 20\" (40 yards). As a limited free action, the dhampir knows the number of undead and can estimate how powerful each one is. \n\n - **LIGHT SENSITIVE:** Dhamphirs suffer a ‚àí1 on Trait rolls requiring sight while in bright light. \n\n - **NIGHT VISION:** Dhampirs ignore all penalties for Illumination. \n\n - **REDUCED VITALITY:** Dhampirs suffer ‚àí1 Toughness. \n\n - **UNDEAD RESISTANCE:** Damphirs get a free reroll to resist contracting diseases and are immune to Energy Drain (see Energy Drain in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). \n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES \n\n - **DAYBORN:** A few dhampirs are born during the day under the blessings of priests, and their blood has weaker ties to their undead bloodline than others. Such dhampirs are unhindered by daylight and lose Light Sensitivity and replace Night Vision with Low Light Vision. \n\n - **FANGS:** On occasion, a dhampir may inherit his father‚Äôs lengthy canines. These dhampir can make bite attacks dealing Str+d4 damage (See Natural Weapons in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). This replaces Undead Resistance. \n\n - **VAMPIRIC EMPATHY:** Though dhampirs often relate poorly to humanoids, some share an affinity with baser creatures. These dhampirs gain the ability to communicate with bats, rats, and wolves. In addition, they get a free reroll on failed Persuasion rolls when dealing with these animals. This replaces Detect Undead.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Dwarf":{"title":"","content":"![[Dwarf.png|right|200]]\n\n# DWARVES\nDwarves are a stoic but stern people, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel enemies, like orcs and goblins. Dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors. Dwarves are lovers of history and tradition, and their long lifespans leads to far less in the way of generational shifts in attitudes, styles, fashions, and trends. If a thing is not broken, they do not fix it or change it; and if it is broken, they fix it rather than replace it. Thrifty as a rule, dwarves are loath to discard anything unless it is truly ruined and unable to be fixed. At the same time, dwarves‚Äô meticulous, near-obsessive attention to detail and durability in their craftsmanship makes that a rare occurrence, as the things they make are built to last. As a result, virtually everything made by dwarves still sees regular use at an age when such items would be relegated to museum pieces, dusty antique shelves, or junkyard fodder by other ancestries. Together, these traits create the impression that dwarves are a people frozen in time. Nothing could be further from the truth, as dwarves are both thoughtful and imaginative, willing to experiment, if keen to refine and perfect a new technique or product before moving on. Dwarves have achieved feats of metallurgy, stonework, and engineering that have consistently outpaced the advances of other societies, though some non-dwarves have used magic to supplement and perfect their own creations to achieve the same ends. They're also typified by stubborn courage and dedication to seeing tasks through to completion, whatever the risks. These traits led dwarves to explore and settle in environments that would cause others to retreat. From the depths of the underworld to the highest mountain peaks, from rusting iron citadels along rocky coasts to squat jungle ziggurats, dwarves have established their enclaves and redoubts, holding them against all comers or perishing to the last and leaving only their enduring monuments. It is said that dwarves are not venturesome or inventive, although, in reality they maintain a focus on and dedication to each task they undertake and vet changes thoroughly before adopting them wholeheartedly. When faced with new circumstances and new needs, they react by applying tried and true tools and techniques systematically, using existing methods whenever possible. If necessity requires, they throw themselves with equal vigor into developing the next perfect procedure for demolishing the obstacles that get in their way. Once their desired goal is obtained, they focus on consolidating each new piece of territory or conceptual advance. Dwarves thus rarely overextend themselves, but they also may miss opportunities to seize the initiative and maximize the advantages they create.\n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nDwarves are short and stocky, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. They pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse‚Äîno one familiar with their culture trusts a beardless dwarven man.\n\n### SOCIETY \nThe distances between dwarves‚Äô mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves are characterized by their love of stonework, passion for stone- and metalbased craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves where these enemies are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves‚Äô fixation on security combined with their pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus all dwarves are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves adopt what they call ‚Äúaggressive negotiations.‚Äù Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder‚Äîespecially when good ale is involved. \n\n**Relations:** Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a long history of violence. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail, flighty, or ‚Äúpretty‚Äù to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans‚Äô industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.\n\n### ADVENTURERS\nDwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels.\n\n**Languages:** Common and Dwarven. \n**Age Range:** Adult 45, old age 188, max age 250 -450. \n**Dwarf Males:** Height 3'11-4'5 and weight 164-206 (Average 4'2\" , 185 lbs). \n**Dwarf Females:** Height: 3'9\"-4'3\" and weight 134-176 (Average 4'0\", 165 lbs). \n\n- **DARKVISION:** Dwarven eyes are accustomed to the dark of the underearth. Dwarves ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10‚Äù (20 yards). \n\n -  **IRON CONSTITUTION:** Dwarves add +1 when resisting poison. They also add +1 when resisting or recovering from powers or abilities that state they work like a power. \n\n - **REDUCED PACE**: Decrease the character‚Äôs Pace by 1 and reduce the running die by one die type. \n\n - **STONECUNNING:** Dwarves grow up in halls and caverns of worked stone, and get a Notice roll at +2 as a free action within 10 feet of unusual stonework such as traps and hidden doors. Success means they know something is off, and a raise gives them more specific information such as how to trigger the trap or open the door. \n\n - **TOUGH:** Stout and tough, Dwarves start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. This increases maximum Vigor to d12 + 1. They treat their Strength as one die type higher when determining Encumbrance (see page 104) and Minimum Strength to use armor and equipment without penalty (but not weapons). This ability stacks with the Brawny Edge if the dwarf has it.\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n - **MINESIGHT:** Dwarves with this ability gain Night Vision; however, they are automatically Shaken when exposed to bright light and suffer ‚àí1 on sight-based rolls while remaining in bright light. This replaces Darkvision. \n\n - **ROCK STEPPER:** Dwarves with this ability can skillfully negotiate rocky terrain. They can ignore Difficult Ground created by rubble, broken ground, steep stairs or similar effects. This ability replaces Stonecunning. \n\n - **STONESINGER:** Some dwarves‚Äô affinity for the earth grants them greater powers. When spending a Benny to reroll arcane skill rolls, add +2 to the total. This only applies when activating a power with an earth or stone Trapping. This replaces Stonecunning.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Elf":{"title":"","content":"![[Elf.png|right|200]]\n\n# ELVES \nThe long-lived elves are children of the natural world. They seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves‚Äô long lifespans. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than bending it to their will. Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted, the resulting alliances can last for generations. Elves take joy in forging alliances with those that share or exceed their long lifetimes, and often work to befriend dragons, outsiders, and fey. Those who spend their lives among the short-lived, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions die before their eyes. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nGenerally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique. It is a mistake to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves varies wildly as their coloration often matches their surroundings. Although, elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones. Elves‚Äô bodies change over time, taking on a physical representation of their mental and spiritual states. Additionally, those who dwell in a region for a long period of time find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, such as taking on coloration that reflects the local environment. \n\n### SOCIETY \nMany elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. When driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region‚Äôs bounty, and learn how to maximize what can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather. Most find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery. When such work must be done, regardless of their craftsmanship, such ‚Äúdirt-wrights‚Äù are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Arcane research and accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise lavished upon elven wizards. \n\n**Relations:** Elves are prone to writing off outsiders as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another culture, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing their ancestry as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn‚Äôt understand why his ‚Äúspecial friend‚Äù is upset the elf has noticed the friend is ‚Äúso much better than the rest of his kind.‚Äù Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking. Elves are not foolish enough to dismiss all aspects of other cultures. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge dwarves‚Äô skill at smithing and their tenacity in facing orc threats. Elves regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, but regard their magical talent as being worthy of praise and respect. Halflings are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, who seem to live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any sort and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion. \n\n**Religion:** Elves prefer deities who share their love of the mystic qualities of the world‚ÄîDesna and Nethys are particular favorites, the former for her wonder and love of the wild places, and the latter for his mastery of magic. Calistria is perhaps the most notorious of elven deities, for she represents elven ideals taken to an extreme. Elves accept in Calistria (and her priests) behavior they would denounce in others, because Calistria is clearly (to elves‚Äô perceptions) serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification. \n\n### ADVENTURERS \nMany elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten magic or search out lost kingdoms. This need is accepted as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. For elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes‚Äîwatching friends and family swiftly age and die‚Äîis often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal.\n\n**Languages:** Common and Elven. \n**Age Range:** Adult 115, old age, 263, max age 350-750. \n**Elf Males:** Height 5'6-6'8 and weight 116-158 (Average 6'1\" , 127 lbs). \n**Elf Females:** Height 5'6\"-6'4\" and weight 96-126 (Average 6'1\", 117 lbs). \n\n - **AGILE:** Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. \n\n - **ELVEN MAGIC:** Elves have an inherent connection to arcane energies. Elves get a free reroll when rolling to resist enemy powers. \n\n - **INTELLIGENCE:** Elves are highly intelligent and long-lived. They start with a d6 in Smarts instead of a d4. This increases maximum Smarts to d12 + 1. \n\n - **KEEN SENSES:** Elves start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Notice to d12 + 1. \n\n - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Elven eyes amplify light. Others often claim they can see stars in the elves‚Äô eyes. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination. \n\n - **SLENDER:** Slight of build and less robust than others, elves suffer ‚àí1 Toughness and ‚Äì1 to Vigor rolls.\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n\n - **DESERT RUNNER:** Some elves thrive in deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. These elves get a free reroll to avoid Fatigue, Exhaustion, or other ill effects from forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This replaces Elven Magic.\n\n - **DREAMSPEAKER:** A few elves have the ability to tap into the power of sleep, dreams, and prescient reverie. An elf with this ability adds +1 to rolls made to resist suffering Fatigue from lack of sleep. In addition, each night the elf can send his consciousness into the mind of a dreamer he knows.  The character can deliver a message before returning to his body. The recipient remembers the message perfectly upon waking up. This replaces Keen Senses.\n\n - **URBANITE:** Elves living in cities for more than a century learn the ebb and flow of social situations. These elves get a free reroll when Networking. This replaces Keen Senses.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Gnome":{"title":"","content":"![[Gnome.png|right|200]]\n\n# GNOMES\nGnomes are distant relatives of the fey, and their history tells of a time when they lived in the fey‚Äôs mysterious realm, a place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots. Gnomes are often driven by passions and desires that non-gnomes see as eccentric at best, and nonsensical at worst. A gnome may risk his life to taste the food at a giant‚Äôs table, to reach the bottom of a pit just because it would be the lowest place he‚Äôs ever been, or to tell jokes to a dragon‚Äîand to the gnome those goals are as worthy as researching a new spell, gaining vast wealth, or putting down a powerful evil force. While such apparently fickle and impulsive acts are not universal among gnomes, they are common enough for the cultures as a whole to have earned a reputation for being impetuous and at least a little mad. Gnomes are often amazed how alike other common, civilized cultures are. It seems stranger to a gnome that humans and elves share so many similarities than that the gnomes do not. Indeed, gnomes often confound their allies by treating everyone who is not a gnome as part of a single, vast non-gnome collective.\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\nGnomes generally stand just over three feet in height. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes larger than themselves. The coloration of gnomes varies so wildly that many outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly not above cosmetic enhancement, their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes‚Äô coloration has little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome‚Äôs parents having no apparent bearing on the gnome‚Äôs appearance. Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and their proportions often don‚Äôt match the norm of other humanoids. Many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their features, but outsiders often fixate on a gnome‚Äôs most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the focus of insults or endearments.\n### SOCIETY\nGnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other ancestries. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a ‚Äúgnome quarter,‚Äù and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them. Whimsical creatures at heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring relationships, instead pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that borders on zealotry. If a gnome does settle in an area or stay with a group for a longer period, it is almost always the result of some benefit that area gives to a vocation or obsession to which the gnome had dedicated himself. Despite their varied backgrounds and lack of a unifying homeland, gnomes do possess some common cultural traits. Males have a strange fondness for unusual hats and headgear, often wearing the most expensive and ostentatious head-covering they can afford. Females rarely cover their heads, but proudly wear elaborate and eccentric hairstyles that often include jeweled combs and headpieces.\n\n**Relations:** Gnomes have difficulty interacting with others, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways the very fact other cultures see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. The inability or unwillingness of members of other cultures to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes. In many ways, it is gnomes‚Äô strong connection to a wide range of apparently unconnected ideas that makes it difficult for other races to build relationships with them. Gnome humor, for example, is often focused on physical pranks, nonsensical rhyming nicknames, and efforts to convince others of outrageous lies that strain all credibility. Gnomes find such efforts hysterically funny, but their pranks often come across as malicious or senseless to other races, while gnomes in turn tend to think of the taller races as dull and lumbering giants. Gnomes get along reasonably well with halflings and humans, who at least have some traditions of bizarre, gnomelike humor. Gnomes generally feel dwarves and half-orcs need to lighten up, and attempt to bring levity into their lives with tricks, jokes, and outrageous tales the more dour races simply cannot see the sense of. Gnomes respect elves, but often grow frustrated with the slow pace at which members of the long-lived race make decisions. To gnomes, action is always better than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest periods.\n\n### ADVENTURERS\n\n**Languages:** Common, Gnome, and Sylvan. \n**Age Range:** Adult 45, old age 150, max age 200-500. \n**Gnome Males:** Height 3'2-3'8 and weight 37-43 (Average 3'5\" , 40 lbs). \n**Gnome Females:** Height 3'-3'6\" and weight 32-38 (Average 3'3\", 35 lbs). \n\n - **GNOME MAGIC:** Gnomes can cast cantrips (see page 171) as if they knew each of the following powers: light, sound, telekinesis, and beast friend using their Smarts (or arcane skill if they have one). They have 1 Power Point for activating these cantrips, regained as usual (see page 169). Gnomes with an Arcane Background or Mystic Power add their bonus Power Point to their pool but must still learn the spells if they wish to cast them normally. \n\n - **KEEN SENSES:** Gnomes start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Notice to d12 + 1. \n\n - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Gnome eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination. \n\n - **OBSESSIVE:** Gnomes start with a d4 in any one Smarts-related skill. \n\n - **REDUCED PACE:** Decrease the character‚Äôs Pace by 1 and reduce the running die by one die type. \n\n - **SIZE ‚àí1:** Averaging roughly three and a half feet tall, gnomes reduce their Size and Toughness by 1. \n\n - **TOUGH:** Gnomes are surprisingly hardy despite their size and strength. They start with a d6 in Vigor instead of a d4. This increases maximum Vigor to d12 + 1.\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n\n - ETERNAL HOPE: Gnomes rarely lose hope and are always confident that even hopeless situations will work out. Gnomes with this ability add +1 to their Fear checks. This replaces Keen Senses.\n\n - GIFT OF TONGUES: Gnomes love languages and learning about those they meet. Gnomes with this ability know two additional languages of their choice. This replaces Obsessive.\n\n - WARDEN OF NATURE: Gnomes must often protect their homes against unnatural or pestilential infestations. These gnomes gain +1 Parry against Aberrations, Oozes, and Vermin because of their special training. This replaces Obsessive.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Goblin":{"title":"","content":"# GOBLINS \nIt‚Äôs been almost 20 years since the end of the Goblinblood Wars that scorched the Chitterwood, forcing dozens of tribes into hiding. Now with new threats rising up, the many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that give them a chance at survival. While many have stayed to protect their homelands, others have become refugees, with some traveling to Absalom in search of a home that might offer them sanctuary in a world that does not trust them. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nGoblins are short, ugly humanoids. Their scrawny bodies are topped with oversized and usually hairless heads with massive ears and beady red or occasionally yellow eyes. Goblins‚Äô skin tone varies based on the surrounding environment; common skin tones include green, gray, and blue, though black and even pale white goblins have been sighted. Their voracious appetites are served well by their huge mouths filled with jagged teeth. \n\n### SOCIETY \nEven those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins‚Äô woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour meals that might turn others‚Äô stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions‚Äô trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins‚Äô friends consider these qualities endearing. Goblins reach adolescence by the age of three and adulthood four or five years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue. \n\n**Relations:** Though goblins‚Äô culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin‚Äôs friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance‚Äî something that a goblin does not give freely. \n\n**Religion:** Many goblin adventurers typically worship Cayden Cailean. \n\n### ADVENTURERS \nSome backgrounds make for particularly good adventurers. Goblins who come from lawless tribes may seek refuge while entertainers may seek a living performing for audiences around the world. Many goblins consider alchemy, since they love fire or life as a bard, since many goblins love songs. Scrappy survivors often take to the role of a rogue who darts about the shadows, though their natural charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical power, such as that of a sorcerer or wizard. \n\n**Languages:** Common, Goblin. \n\n - **AGILE:** Goblins are fast and agile. They start with a d8 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 2. \n\n - **CAPABLE RIDER:** Goblins start with a d4 in Riding. \n\n - **DARKVISION:** Goblin eyes are able to pierce the darkness. They ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10‚Äù (20 yards). \n\n - **OUTSIDER (Major):** Almost every non-goblin culture is suspicious of goblins. They subtract 2 from all Persuasion rolls and are often bullied by others. \n\n - **SIZE ‚àí1:** Averaging roughly three feet tall, goblins reduce their Size and Toughness by 1. \n\n - **SNEAKY:** Goblins start with a d6 in Stealth instead of a d4. This increases maximum Stealth to d12 + 1. \n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES \n\n - **EAT ANYTHING:** Raised with little or no proper food, many goblins have learned to survive by eating whatever they happen across and can digest nearly anything without getting sick. Goblins with this ability get a free reroll on Survival checks to forage for food and a +2 bonus on Vigor checks caused by consuming toxic substances. This ancestral ability replaces Capable Rider. \n\n - **HARD HEAD, BIG TEETH:** Goblins are known for their balloonlike heads and enormous maws, but some have even more exaggeratedly large heads filled with razor-sharp teeth. Goblins with this trait gain a bite (Str+d4). This ancestral ability replaces Sneaky. \n\n - **OVER-SIZED EARS:** While goblins‚Äô ears are never dainty, these goblins have freakishly large ears capable of picking up even the smallest sounds. Goblins with this ancestral ability start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases maximum Notice to d12 + 1. This replaces Capable Rider.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Half-Elf":{"title":"","content":"![[Half Elf.png|right|200]]\n\n# HALF-ELVES\nSince the two first came into contact with each other, humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in these fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, and are drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which they play out their brief lives. Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually shortlived, even by human standards, such trysts may lead to the birth of half-elves, an ancestry descended from two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves alike. Caught between destiny and derision, half-elves often view themselves as the middle children of the world.\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\nHalf-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.\n\n### SOCIETY\nTheir lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to elves and humans, half-elves rarely fit in with either. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. Even half-elves welcomed by one side of their heritage often find themselves caught between cultures, as they are encouraged, cajoled into taking on diplomatic responsibilities between humans and elves.\n**Relations:** Half-elves understand loneliness, and know that character is often less a product of their bloodline than of life experience. As such, they are less likely than most to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances. Those humans who admire elvenkind see half-elves as a living link or bridge between the two. But this attitude often foists unfair expectations upon half-elves, and quickly turns to derision when they do not live up to the destinies others set for them. Additionally, half-elves raised by or in the company of elves often have the human half of their parentage dubbed as something to overcome. Among other cultures, half-elves form unique and often unexpected bonds. Dwarves, despite their traditional mistrust of elves, see a half-elf‚Äôs human parentage as something hopeful, and treat them as half-humans rather than half-elves. Additionally, the lifespan of dwarves is closer to a half-elf‚Äôs own than that of either of her parents. As a result, half-elves and dwarves often form lasting bonds. Gnomes and halflings often see half-elves as a curiosity. Those half-elves who have seen themselves pushed to the edges of society, truly without a home, typically find gnomes and halflings frivolous and worthy of disdain, but secretly envy their seemingly carefree ways. Clever and enterprising gnomes and halflings sometimes partner with a half-elf for adventures or even business ventures, using the half-elf‚Äôs participation to lend their own endeavors an air of legitimacy that they cannot acquire on their own. Perhaps the most peculiar and dichotomous relations exist between half-elves and half-orcs. Those halforcs and half-elves who were raised among their non-human kin normally see one another as hated and ancient foes. Half-elves who have been marginalized by society feel a deep, almost instant kinship with half-orcs, knowing their burdens are often that much harder because of their appearance and somewhat brutish nature. Not all half-orcs are inclined or able to understand such empathy, but those who do often find themselves with a dedicated diplomat, liaison, and apologist. For their own part, half-orcs usually return the favor by acting as bodyguards and take on other roles suited to their brawny forms.\n**Religion:** Half-elves‚Äô lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland. Some half-elves feel the pull of the divine but live beyond the formal religious instruction of society. Such individuals often worship ideas and concepts like freedom, harmony, balance, or the primal forces of the world. Still others gravitate toward long-forgotten gods, finding comfort and kinship in the idea that even deities can be overlooked.\n\n### ADVENTURERS\nHalf-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering in search of a place to call home. The desire to prove themselves to the community and establish a personal identity‚Äîor even a legacy‚Äî drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery. Despite their longevity, some half-elves claim they perceive the passage of time more like humans than elves, and are driven to amass wealth, power, or fame early on in life so they may spend the rest of their years enjoying it.\n\n**Languages:** Common and Elven. \n**Age Range:** Adult 22, old age 93, max age 125-185. \n**Half-elf Males:** Height 5'4-6'6 and weight 110-180 (Average 5'11\" , 155 lbs). \n**Half-elf Females:** Height 5'2\"-6'4\" and weight 100-170 (Average 5'9\", 135 lbs). \n\n - **ELVEN MAGIC:** Half-elves have an inherent connection to arcane energies. They get a free reroll when rolling to resist enemy powers. \n\n - **FLEXIBILITY:** Half-elves start with a d6 in any one Attribute instead of a d4. This does not increase the attribute maximum. \n\n - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Half-elven eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.\n\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n\n - DROW MAGIC: A few half-elves with drow ancestry exhibit the innate magic of their ancestors. They have 1 Power Point and can cast darkness, using their Smarts (or arcane skill if they have one) to activate this power. This replaces Elven Magic.\n\n - WARY: Many half-elves have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others‚Äô motivations. These half elves get a free reroll when deceiving others or attempting to detect when they are being deceived. They gain the Suspicious (Minor) Hindrance, but not any Hindrance points.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Half-Orc":{"title":"","content":"![[Half Orc.png|right|200]]\n\n# HALF-ORCS\nHalf-orcs are seen as monstrosities, the result of perversion and violence‚Äîwhether or not this is actually true. Half-orcs are rarely the result of loving unions, and as such are usually forced to grow up hard and fast, constantly fighting for protection or to make names for themselves. A few feared, distrusted, and spat-upon half-orcs manage to surprise their detractors with great deeds and unexpected wisdom‚Äîthough sometimes it‚Äôs easier just to crack a few skulls. Some half-orcs spend their entire lives proving to full-blooded orcs that they are just as fierce. Others try to blend into human society, constantly demonstrating they aren‚Äôt monsters. Their need to always prove themselves worthy encourages half-orcs to strive for power and greatness within the society around them.\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\nHalf-orcs average around six feet tall, with powerful builds and greenish or grayish skin. Their canine teeth often grow long enough to protrude from their mouths, and these ‚Äútusks,‚Äù combined with heavy brows and slightly pointed ears, give them their notoriously bestial appearance. While half-orcs may be impressive, few ever describe them as beautiful. Despite these obvious orc traits, half-orcs are as varied as their human parents.\n### SOCIETY\nUnlike half-elves, half-orcs get the worst of both worlds: physically weaker than orcs, they also tend to be feared by humans who don‚Äôt bother making the distinction between full orcs and halfbloods. Even on the best of terms, half-orcs in civilized societies are not exactly accepted, and tend to be valued only for their physical abilities. On the other hand, orc leaders have been known to deliberately spawn half-orcs, as the halfbreeds make up for their lack of physical strength with cunning and aggression. Within orc tribes, half-orcs find themselves striving to prove their worth with feats of strength. These half-orcs are likely to file their tusks and cover themselves in tribal tattoos. Tribal leaders quietly recognize that halforcs are more clever than most orcs and often apprentice them to the tribe‚Äôs shaman. Apprenticeship to a shaman is a brutal and often shortlived distinction and those who survive it either become influential in the tribe or are driven to leave. Half-orcs have a mixed experience in human society, where many view them as little more than monsters. They often are unable to get normal work, and are pressed into service in the military or sold into slavery. In these cultures, half-orcs often lead furtive lives, hiding their nature whenever possible. Less commonly, human cities may allow half-orcs a more normal existence, even enabling them to develop small communities of their own. These communities are usually centered around the arena districts, the military, or mercenary organizations where their brute strength is valued and their appearance is more likely to be overlooked. Even surrounded by their own kind, half-orc life isn‚Äôt easy. Bullying and physical confrontation comes easy to a people who have been raised with few other examples of behavior. Even more rarely, certain human cultures come to embrace half-orcs for their strength. There are stories of places where people see half-orc children as a blessing and seek out half-orc or orc lovers.\n\n**Relations:** Elves and dwarves tend to be the least accepting of half-orcs, seeing in them too great a resemblance to their racial enemies, and other races aren‚Äôt much more understanding. A lifetime of persecution leaves the average half-orc wary and quick to anger, yet people who break through his savage exterior might find a well-hidden core of empathy. Human societies with few orc problems tend to be the most accommodating, and half-orcs dwelling there can often find work as mercenaries and enforcers. Half-orcs are envious of the measure of acceptance half-elves have within human and elven society and resent their physical beauty, which contrasts starkly to the half-orcs‚Äô brutish appearance. While half-orcs avoid antagonizing their half-breed cousins directly, they won‚Äôt hesitate to undermine them if the opportunity presents itself. Half-orcs are most sympathetic with halflings, who often have an equally rough lot in life. Half-orcs respect their ability to blend in and disappear and admire their perpetually cheerful outlook on life in spite of hardships. Halflings fail to appreciate this fact because they usually are too busy avoiding the large, intimidating half-orcs.\n**Religion:** Half-orcs worship the human or orc gods venerated in the area where they were raised. Those who live alongside humans most often worship human gods of war, freedom, or destruction. Half-orcs raised in orc tribes find themselves most drawn to the gods of blood, fire, and iron‚Äîdepending more on what god the tribe worships rather than the half-orcs‚Äô personal preference. Many half-orcs are contrary about religion, either ignoring it entirely, or getting deeply involved in it and trying to find meaning in a life filled with hate and misunderstanding.\n### ADVENTURERS\nStaunchly independent, many half-orcs take to lives of adventure out of necessity, seeking to escape their painful pasts or improve their lot in life. Half-orcs raised in orc societies often take up the brutish ways of those around them. Those who survive their shaman training may eventually succeed their masters as tribal shamans, or flee and practice their magic as outcasts. Half-orcs are fascinated by alchemy, and its destructive capabilities make its usefulness obvious in any orc tribe. Half-orc alchemists treat themselves as living experiments, even to the point of trying to separate their orc and human halves through alchemy.\n\n**Languages:** Common and Orc. \n**Age Range:** Adult 15, old age 45, max age60-80. \n**Half-orc Males:** Height 5'-6'10 and weight 164-318 (Average 5'11\", 241 lbs). \n**Half-orc Females:** Height 4'7\"-6'5\" and weight 124-278 (Average 5'6\", 201 lbs). \n\n - **DARKVISION:** Half-orcs ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10‚Äù (20 yards). \n\n - **INTIMIDATING:** By their very nature, half-orcs inspire fear and awe. They start with a d4 in Intimidation. This increases maximum Intimidation to d12 + 1. \n\n - **ORC FEROCITY:** Half-orcs are as tough as old boots. They gain +1 Toughness. \n\n - **OUTSIDER (MINOR):** Most cultures are suspicious of half-orcs, and orcish societies distrust their human sides. They subtract 2 from all Persuasion rolls and are often resented or belittled by others. \n\n - **STRONG:** Half-orcs possess some of the might of their orcish ancestry. They start with a d6 in Strength instead of a d4. This increases maximum Strength to d12 + 1.\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n - SACRED TATTOO: Many half-orcs decorate themselves with tattoos, piercings, and ritual scarification, which they consider sacred. Half-orcs with this ability gain an additional Novice power the first time they take an Arcane Background. This replaces Orc Ferocity.\n - SCAVENGER: Some half-orcs eke out a living picking over the garbage heaps of society, and must learn to separate rare finds from the inevitable dross. These half-orcs have +1 on Notice rolls to find hidden objects (including traps and secret doors), determine whether food is spoiled, or identify a potion by taste (see detect magic in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). This replaces Intimidating.\n - SKILLED: Second- and third-generation half-orcs often favor their human heritage more than their orc heritage. Half-orcs with this ability start with 14 skill points instead of 12. This replaces Darkvision.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Halfling":{"title":"","content":"![[Halfling.png|right|200]]\n\n# HALFLINGS\nOptimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by a powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easy-going, halflings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on opportunity, and are not as prone to violent or emotional outbursts as other ancestries. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, halflings almost never lose their sense of humor. Their ability to find humor in the absurd, no matter how dire the situation, often allows halflings to distance themselves ever so slightly from the dangers that surround them. Halflings are inveterate opportunists. They firmly believe they can turn any situation to their advantage, and sometimes gleefully leap into trouble without any solid plan to extricate themselves. Often unable to physically defend themselves from the rigors of the world, they know when to bend with the wind and when to hide away. Yet halflings‚Äô curiosity often overwhelms their good sense, leading to poor decisions and narrow escapes. Though their curiosity drives them to seek out new places and experiences, halflings possess a strong sense of hearth and home, often spending above their means to enhance the comforts of domestic life. Halflings enjoy luxury and comfort, but they have equally strong reasons to make their homes a showcase. Halflings consider this urge to devote time, money, and energy toward improving their dwellings a sign of both respect for strangers and affection for their loved ones. Halflings make their homes beautiful in order to express their feelings toward those they welcome inside. Even traveling halflings typically decorate their wagons or carry a few cherished keepsakes to adorn their campsites.\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\nHalflings rise to a humble height of three feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Their skin tends toward a rich cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling‚Äôs ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human. Halflings prefer simple and modest clothing. Though willing and able to dress up if the situation demands it, their urge to remain quietly in the background makes them rather conservative dressers in most situations. Halfling entertainers, on the other hand, make their livings by drawing attention, and tend to go overboard with gaudy and flashy costumes.\n### SOCIETY\nRather than place their faith in empires, many halflings prefer to focus on the simpler virtues of their families and local communities. Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Most often, they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives, traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer. Halflings rely on customs and traditions to maintain their own culture. They have an extensive oral history filled with important stories about folk heroes who exemplify particular halfling virtues, but otherwise see little purpose in studying history in and of itself. Given a choice between a pointless truth and a useful fable, halflings almost always opt for the fable. This tendency helps to explain at least something of the famous halfling adaptability. Halflings look to the future and find it very easy to cast off the weight of ancient grudges or obligations that drag down so many other races.\n**Relations:** A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go unnoticed by others‚Äîa trait that allows many halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings know full well the stereotypical view others take of them as a result, and go out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger ancestries when they‚Äôre not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but they often live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy. By and large, only half-orcs are shunned by halflings, for their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for most halflings to cope with. Halflings coexist well with humans as a general rule, but since some of the more aggressive human societies value halflings as slaves, they try not to grow too complacent.\n**Religion:** Always practical, halflings frequently worship the deity most favored by their larger and more powerful neighbors. They also usually cover their bets, however, by giving Desna her due. The goddess of both luck and travel seems a natural fit for most halflings and offering her a quick prayer every now and then is only common sense.\n### ADVENTURERS\nTheir inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal candidates for lives of adventure. Though perfectly willing to pocket any valuables they come across, halflings often care more for the new experiences adventuring brings them than for any material reward. Others often put up with this curious ancestry in hopes that some of their mystical luck will rub off. Halflings see nothing wrong with encouraging this belief, not just in their traveling companions, but also in the larger world. Many try to use their reputation for luck to haggle for reduced fare when traveling by ship or caravan, or even for an overnight stay at an inn, though this it met with mixed success.\n\n**Languages:** Common and Halfling. \n**Age Range:** Adult 22, old age 75, max age100-200. \n**Halfling Males:** Height 2'10-3'4 and weight 32-38 (Average 3'1\" , 35 lbs). \n**Halfling Females:** Height 2'8\"-3'2\" and weight 27-33 (Average 2'11\", 30 lbs). \n\n - **AGILE:** Halflings are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. \n\n - **KEEN SENSES:** Keen senses allow halflings to catch details others might miss. They start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases maximum Notice to d12 + 1. \n\n - **LUCKY:** Halflings have a knack for surviving. They gain the Luck Edge. Even halfling Extras gain this ability! \n\n - **REDUCED PACE:** Decrease Pace by 1 and reduce the running die by one die type. \n\n - **SIZE ‚àí1:** Halflings reduce their Size and Toughness by 1. \n\n - **SURE-FOOTED:** Naturally graceful, halflings start with a d6 in Athletics instead of a d4. This increases maximum Athletics to d12 + 1.\n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES\n - ADAPTABLE LUCK: Some halflings have control over their innate luck. Once per session, this character can spend a Benny to reroll a Critical Failure. This replaces Lucky.\n - FLEET OF FOOT: Some halflings are quicker than their kin but less cautious. These halflings draw one additional card when using the Quick Chase deck. Additionally, they do not reduce their Pace due to Wound penalties. This replaces Keen Senses.\n - LOW BLOW: Some halflings train extensively in the art of attacking larger creatures. Halflings with this ability gain +2 AP when attacking creatures at least 3 Sizes larger than themselves. This replaces Sure-Footed.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Human":{"title":"","content":"![[Human.png|right|200]]\n\n# HUMANS\nHumans possess exceptional drive and a great capacity to endure and expand, and as such are currently the dominant people in the world. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and the citizens of these societies carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is best characterized by its tumultuousness and diversity, and human cultures run the gamut from savage but honorable tribes to decadent, devil-worshiping noble families in the most cosmopolitan cities. Human society is a strange amalgam of nostalgia and futurism, being enamored of past glories and wistfully remembered ‚Äúgolden ages,‚Äù yet at the same time quick to discard tradition and history and strike off into new ventures. Relics of the past are kept as prized antiques and museum pieces, as humans love to collect things‚Äînot only inanimate relics but also living creatures‚Äîto display for their amusement or to serve by their side. Humans in many places are fascinated by older cultures, though at times they grow frustrated or even contemptuous of ancient and (to their mind) outmoded traditions. Their attitudes toward other ancestries are thus a curious mix of exoticism and even fetishism, though usually with a very superficial level of understanding and appreciation of those cultures, alongside a deeply rooted arrogance that means most humans have a hard time regarding themselves as anything other than the default standard of society. Humans are gregarious, often friendly, and willing to mix and interact with others, but their sheer obliviousness to their offhanded marginalization of others is what so chagrins others when dealing with them. Of course, well-meaning, blundering ignorance and numerical superiority are not the only things that make other ancestries suspicious of humans. Entirely too many examples can be found throughout history wherein human xenophobia and intolerance has led to social isolationism, civil oppression, bloody purges, inquisitions, mob violence, and open war. Humans are not the only ones to hate what is different among them, but they seem to have a susceptibility to fear-mongering and suspicion, whether about ancestry, language, religion, class, gender, or another difference. More moderate human citizens often sit idly by while their more extreme compatriots dominate the political and cultural conversation, yet there are also many who stand in opposition to extremists and embody a spirit of unity across the bounds of difference, transcending barriers and forming alliances and relationships both large and small across every color, creed, country, or species.\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION\nTheir physical characteristics are as varied as the world‚Äôs climes. From the dark-skinned tribesmen of the southern continents to the pale and barbaric raiders of the northern lands, humans possess a wide variety of skin colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, humans‚Äô skin color assumes a darker hue the closer to the equator they live. At the same time, bone structure, hair color and texture, eye color, and a host of facial and bodily phenotypic characteristics vary immensely from one locale to another. Cheekbones may be high or broad, noses aquiline or flat, and lips full or thin; eyes range wildly in hue, some deep set in their sockets, and others with full epicanthic folds. Appearance is hardly random, of course, and familial, tribal, or national commonalities allow the knowledgeable to identify a human‚Äôs place of origin on sight, or at least to hazard a guess. Humans‚Äô origins are also indicated through their styles of bodily decoration, not only in the clothing or jewelry worn, but also in hairstyles, piercing, tattooing, and even scarification.\n### SOCIETY\nHuman society comprises a multitude of governments, attitudes, and lifestyles. Though the oldest human cultures trace their histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to societies like those of elves and dwarves, human society seems to be in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old. In general, humans are known for their flexibility, ingenuity, and ambition. Other races sometimes envy humans their seemingly limitless adaptability, not so much biologically speaking but in their willingness to step beyond the known and press on to whatever might await them. While many or even most humans as individuals are content to stay within their comfortable routine, there is a dauntless spirit of discovery endemic to humans as a species that drives them in striving toward possibilities beyond every horizon.\n**Relations:** Humans are fecund, and their drive and numbers often spur them into contact with other ancestries during bouts of territorial expansion and colonization. In many cases, this tendency leads to violence and war, yet humans are also swift to forgive and forge alliances with those who do not try to match or exceed them in violence. Proud, sometimes to the point of arrogance, humans might look upon dwarves as miserly drunkards, elves as flighty fops, halflings as craven thieves, gnomes as twisted maniacs, and half-elves and half-orcs as embarrassments‚Äîbut the diversity among its own members also makes many humans quite adept at accepting others for what they are. Humans may become so absorbed in their own affairs that they remain ignorant of the language and culture of others, and some take this ignorance to a hateful extreme of intolerance, oppression, and rarely even extermination of others they perceive as dangerous, strange, or ‚Äúimpure.‚Äù Thankfully, while such incidents and movements may taint all of humanity in the eyes of some, they are more often the exception than the rule.\n**Religion:** Humans have the widest range of gods and religions, lacking other ancestries‚Äô ties to tradition and eager to turn to anyone offering them glory or protection.\n### ADVENTURERS\nAmbition alone drives countless humans, and for many, adventuring serves as a means to an end, whether it be wealth, acclaim, social status, or arcane knowledge. A few pursue adventuring careers simply for the thrill of danger. Humans hail from myriad regions and backgrounds, and as such can fill any role within an adventuring party.\n\n**Languages:** Common. \n**Age Range:** Adult 17, old age 53, max age 70-110 \n**Human Males:** Height 5'-6'6 and weight 130-220 (Average 5'9\" , 175 lb). \n**Human Females:** Height 4'7\"-6'1\" and weight 95-185 (Average 5'4\", 140 lb). \n\n - **ADAPTABILITY:** Humans start with a free Edge (they must meet the requirements, as usual). They also gain a d6 in any one Attribute instead of a d4. This does not increase the attribute limit.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Ancestries/Tiefling":{"title":"","content":"# TIEFLINGS \nSimultaneously more and less than mortal, tieflings are the offspring of humans and fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, tieflings are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most tieflings never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon. Despite their fiendish appearance and netherworld origins, tieflings have a human‚Äôs capacity for choosing their fate, and while many embrace their dark heritage and side with fiendish powers, others reject their darker predilections. Though the power of their blood calls nearly every tiefling to fury, destruction, and wrath, even the spawn of a succubus can become a saint and the grandchild of a pit fiend an unsuspecting hero. \n\n### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION \nNo two tieflings look alike; the fiendish blood running through their veins manifests inconsistently, granting them an array of fiendish traits. One might appear as a human with small horns, a barbed tail, and oddly colored eyes, while another might manifest a mouth of fangs, tiny wings, and claws, and yet another might possess the perpetual smell of blood, foul incenses, and brimstone. Typically, these qualities hearken back in some way to the manner of fiend that spawned the tiefling‚Äôs bloodline, but even then the mixture of human and fiendish blood is rarely ruled by sane, mortal laws, and the vast flexibility it produces in tieflings is a thing of wonder, running the gamut from oddly beautiful to utterly terrible. \n\n### SOCIETY \nTieflings on the Material Plane rarely create their own settlements and holdings. Instead, they live on the fringes of the land where they were born or choose to settle. Most societies view tieflings as aberrations or curses, but in cultures where there are frequent interactions with summoned fiends, and especially where the worship of demons, devils, or other evil outsiders is legal or obligatory, tieflings might be much more populous and accepted, even cherished as blessings of their fiendish overlords. Tieflings seldom see another of their own kind, and so usually simply adopt the culture and mannerisms of their human parents. On other planes, tieflings form enclaves of their own kind. Often such enclaves are less than harmonious‚Äîthe diversity of tiefling forms and philosophies is an inherent source of conflict between them, and cliques and factions constantly form in an ever-shifting hierarchy where only the most opportunistic or devious gain advantage. Only those of common bloodlines or those who manage to divorce their worldview from the inherently selfish, devious, and evil nature of their birth manage to find true acceptance, camaraderie, and common ground among others of their kind. \n\n**Relations:** Tieflings face a significant amount of prejudice from most other cultures, who view them as fiend-spawn, seeds of evil, monsters, and lingering curses placed upon the world. Far too often, civilized ancestries shun or marginalize them, while more monstrous ones simply fear and reject them unless forced or cowed into acceptance. But half-elves, half-orcs, and‚Äîmost oddly‚Äîaasimars tend to view them as kindred spirits who are too often rejected or who don‚Äôt fit into most societies by virtue of their birth. The widespread assumption that tieflings are innately evil‚Äîill-founded though it may be‚Äîprevents many from easily fitting into most cultures on the Material Plane except in exceedingly cosmopolitan or planar-influenced nations. \n\n**Religion:** Though many assume tieflings worship devils and demons, their religious views are as varied as their physical forms. Individual tieflings worship all manner of deities, but they are just as likely to shun religion all together. Those who give in to the dark whispers that haunt the psyche of all tieflings serve all manner of powerful fiends. \n\n### ADVENTURERS \nTieflings rarely integrate into the mortal societies they call home. Drawn to the adventuring life as a method of escape, they hope to make a better life for themselves, to prove their freedom from their blood‚Äôs taint, or to punish a world that fears and rejects them. \n\n**Languages:** Abyssal, Common, and Infernal. \n\n - **AGILE:** Tieflings start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. \n\n - **DARKVISION:** Tieflings ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10‚Äù (20 yards). \n\n - **DARKNESS:** Calling on the shadows, a tiefling can darken an area. Once per day as a limited free action, the tiefling can cast minor darkness as an Innate Power. \n\n - **FIENDISH SORCERY:** Tiefling sorcerers with the Abyssal or Infernal bloodlines reduce the Rank Requirement for Advanced Bloodline to Veteran. \n\n - **INTELLIGENCE:** Tieflings start with a d6 in Smarts instead of a d4. This increases maximum Smarts to d12 + 1. \n\n - **NATIVE OUTSIDER:** A tiefling's Type is Outsider rather than Humanoid. \n\n - **OUTSIDER (MINOR):** Most cultures are suspicious of tieflings. They subtract 2 from all Persuasion rolls and are often resented or belittled by others. \n\n#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES \n\n - **FIENDISH SPRINTER:** Some tieflings have feet that are more bestial than human. Whether their feet resemble those of a clawed predator or are the cloven hooves common to many of their kind, these tieflings gain the Fleet-Footed Edge. This replaces Intelligence. \n\n - **PREHENSILE TAIL:** Some tieflings have long, flexible tails that can be used to carry items. While they cannot wield weapons with their tails, they can use them to retrieve stowed objects carried on their persons as a free action. This replaces Fiendish Sorcery. \n\n - **VESTIGIAL WINGS:** Some tieflings possess a pair of undersized, withered, or stunted wings like a mockery of those of their fiendish forbearer. Sometimes these wings are leathery, like those of a bat. Other times they are covered with a scattering of black, red, or violet feathers. Rare manifestations can take even more bizarre forms. These wings provide limited lift, allowing her to fly at Pace 6. She must make a Vigor roll at the end of every round spent flying or take Fatigue. This replaces Fiendish Sorcery.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Class-specific-rules/Bloodlines-Sorcerer":{"title":"","content":"Below are the bloodlines available to sorcerers.

Diluting a potion costs gp equal to one-quarter of the potion‚Äôs market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again.\n - **FERAL MUTAGEN:** Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he grows claws and fangs, gaining the Claw and Bite Natural Weapons (Str+d6), and a +2 bonus on Intimidation rolls.\n\n# ADVANCED DISCOVERY\nTrue alchemists yearn for the greater\nadvancements in knowledge, to better the\nworld or lord their genius over their peers!\n - **COMBINE EXTRACTS:** Once per day when the alchemist creates his extracts, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This lets the alchemist cast both powers with the same action and Alchemy roll.\n - **ETERNAL YOUTH:** The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward suffers no penalties due to his age.

A delayed bomb detonates immediately if anyone else touches or moves it without a successful Thievery check.\nAn alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at once.

Dispel can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Thievery check (at ‚àí2 if it was created with a raise).\n\n# GRAND DISCOVERY\nThe ultimate feat for any brew master is making a Grand Discovery the world will talk about for generations to come!\n - **FAST HEALING:** The alchemist‚Äôs flesh responds to damage with shocking speed‚Äî he gains the Fast Regeneration ability.\n - **ELIXIR OF LIFE:** Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes one hour of work. When administered by the alchemist who brewed it, it restores life to a dead creature as per resurrection, using the character's Alchemy roll. Alternatively, the alchemist may drink the elixir of life himself, rising as if resurrected if slain within five days of consumption!\n - **PHILOSOPHER‚ÄôS STONE:** The alchemist learns how to create a philosopher‚Äôs stone, and can do so once per month at no cost.

If the stone is broken open (Hardness 14) however, a cavity is revealed at the stone‚Äôs heart. The cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables anyone with at least a d6 in Academics to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher‚Äôs stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). The quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.\nThe quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any healing potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as resurrection for any dead body it‚Äôs sprinkled on.\n\nWeight: 3 lbs.\nDestruction: The philosopher‚Äôs stone can be destroyed by being placed in the heel of a titan‚Äôs boot for at least 1 entire week.","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Class-specific-rules/Domains-Cleric":{"title":"","content":"# DOMAINS\n### CIVILIZATION (COMMUNITY, NOBILITY)\n - ASPECTS: Cities, towns, legacy, linage\n - DEITIES: Abadar, Erastil\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Barrier, disguise, environmental protection, locate, mind link, protection, puppet, speak language, summon ally, warriors gift.\n### DEATH\n - ASPECTS: Birth, fate, prophecy, repose\n - DEITIES: Norgorber, Pharasma, Urgathoa, Zon-Kuthon.\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Blind, bolt, curse, damage field, drain Power Points, fear, mind wipe, planar binding, protection, zombie .\n### DESTRUCTION (EVIL, MADNESS)\n - ASPECTS: Destruction, hate, madness, violence\n - DEITIES: Asmodeus, Gorum, Lamashtu, Nethys, Norgorber, Rovagug, Urgathoa, Zon-Kuthon\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Bolt, confusion, curse, damage field, deflection, drain Power Points, fear, stun, summon ally, zombie\n### ELEMENTAL (AIR, EARTH, FIRE, WATER)\n - ASPECTS: Air, cold, earth, fire, heat, water\n - DEITIES: Abadar, Asmodeus, Gozreh, Pharasma, Sarenrae, Shelyn, Torag\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Barrier, blast, burrow, burst, damage field, deflection, elemental manipulation, environmental protection, havoc, intangibility.\n### GLORY (GOOD, HEALING)\n - ASPECTS: Healing, love, mercy, peace\n - DEITIES: Cayden Cailean, Desna, Erastil, Gorum, Iomedae, Irori, Pharasma, Sarenrae, Shelyn, Torag.\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Arcane protection, barrier, beast friend, burst, damage field, deflection, fly, growth/shrink, sloth/speed, summon ally.\n### KNOWLEDGE\n - ASPECTS: Literacy, history, revealing secrets\n - DEITIES: Calistria, Irori, Nethys, Norgorber, Pharasma\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Arcane Protection, detect/conceal arcana, drain Power Points, locate, mind link, mind reading, object reading, protection, scrying, speak language.\n### LUCK\n - ASPECTS: Chance, fortune, losing, winning\n - DEITIES: Calistria, Desna, Shelyn\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Blind, confusion, curse, deflection, disguise, drain Power Points, illusion, mind reading, object reading, puppet.\n### MAGIC (RUNE)\n - ASPECTS: Arcane power, reality, runes\n - DEITIES: Asmodeus, Irori, Nethys, Urgathoa\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Blast, detect/conceal arcana, elemental manipulation, environmental protection, havoc, planar binding, plane shift, protection, scrying, summon ally.\n### NATURE (ANIMAL, PLANT, WEATHER)\n - ASPECTS: Animals, plants, weather, seas\n - DEITIES: Erastil, Gozreh, Rovagug\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Baleful polymorph, barrier, beast friend, burst, elemental manipulation, entangle, environmental protection, protection, shape change, summon ally, wall walker.\n### PROTECTION\n - ASPECTS: Protection, care-giving, shelter\n - DEITIES: Abadar, Nethys, Shelyn, Torag\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Arcane protection, barrier, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, environmental protection, intangibility, invisibility, puppet, protection, summon ally.\n### STRENGTH\n - ASPECTS: Brawn, champions, contest\n - DEITIES: Cayden Cailean, Gorum, Irori, Lamashtu, Urgathoa\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Arcane Protection, burrow, drain Power Points, growth/shrink, havoc, protection, sloth/speed, stun, wall walker, warriors gift.\n### SUN\n - ASPECTS: Light, radiance, warmth, life\n - DEITIES: Iomedae, Sarenrae\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: blind, bolt, confusion, damage field, drain Power Points, environmental protection, fly, illusion, protection, stun.\n### TRAVEL\n - ASPECTS: Freedom, liberation, wanderlust\n - DEITIES: Abadar, Cayden Cailean, Desna\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: deflection, environmental protection, fly, intangibility, locate, plane shift, scrying, sloth/speed, speak language, teleport.\n### TRICKERY\n - ASPECTS: Chance, deception, secrets, stealth\n - DEITIES: Asmodeus, Calistria, Lamashtu, Norgorber\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Blind, confusion, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, illusion, invisibility, puppet, speak language, time stop.\n### WAR\n - ASPECTS: Battle, bravery, victory\n - DEITIES: Gorum, Iomedae, Rovagug, Urgathoa\n - AVAILABLE POWERS: Barrier, blast, blind, confusion, deflection, fear, speed/sloth, stun, summon ally, warriors gift","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Class-specific-rules/Eidolon-Evolutions-Summoner":{"title":"","content":"\n# Novice Rank Evolutions\n| COST | NOVICE RANK EVOLUTIONS |\n| ---- | --- |\n| 2 | Aquatic: The eidolon is native to the water.

At the end of this time, the target receives a brief image of the near future (usually no more than one year) of the Game Master's discretion. The witch can grant this individual no further visions until this one has come to pass (or not). This is only the most likely version of the future, so such visions are unreliable at best. A witch cannot use this ability on herself.\n - **WAXEN IMAGE:** This hex gives the witch the puppet power if she doesn't already have it. As a limited action, she may create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within a Range of Smarts. She may then cast puppet on the target of her waxen image from any distance. If she can see the target she adds +2 to the roll. The waxen image melts after use, so she must make a new one after each casting.\nThe witch can only have one waxen image at a time. If she creates another, the previous image becomes useless.\n - **WEATHER CONTROL:** The witch may cast elemental manipulation with the Weather Power Modifier at no cost, once per day.\n\n# GRAND HEXES\n - **DEATH CURSE:** As an action, this hex seizes a creature‚Äôs heart, causing death in just a few moments. Death Curse has a Range of 5\" (10 yards), and the target makes a Spirit roll. If failed, the creature takes Fatigue each round until it's Incapacitated, then makes a Vigor check or dies. With success, he takes 3d6 damage (ignoring Armor) and the hex ends. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, though the Fatigue remains. A creature cannot be the target of Death Curse again for an entire day.\n - **ETERNAL SLUMBER:** As a limited action, the witch makes a Touch Attack with Spellcasting. With success, the target makes a Spirit roll (‚àí2 with a raise). Failing this check causes it to fall into a deep slumber from which it cannot be woken except by a wish or by slaying the witch who cast it! A witch can also poison food or drink with her hex, causing the next person to consume it to be affected. She may only have one such poisoned dish at a time, and it loses its potency after one minute if not consumed. A creature can't be affected by Eternal Slumber more than once per day.\n - **FORCED REINCARNATION:** The witch can move and take free actions, but can take no other actions other than performing this hex. The witch makes a Spellcasting roll, targeting her victim within a Range equal to her Smarts. With success, the target must make a Spirit check (at ‚àí2 with a raise on the Spellcasting roll), or die and be immediately reincarnated into a new body (roll on the chart below to see what the creature is). The reincarnated form is still a Wild Card if it was one before the hex was cast. A creature cannot be the target of this hex more than once a day.\n\n| D100 |  CREATURE |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bugbear |\n| 2‚Äì12 | Dwarf |\n| 14‚Äì25 | Elf |\n| 26 | Gnoll |\n| 27‚Äì38 | Gnome |\n| 39‚Äì42 | Goblin |\n| 43‚Äì52 | Half-Elf |\n| 53‚Äì62 | Half-Orc |\n| 63‚Äì74 | Halfling |\n| 75‚Äì89 | Human |\n| 90‚Äì93 | Kobold |\n| 94 | Lizardfolk |\n| 95‚Äì98 | Orc |\n| 99 | Troglodyte |\n| 100 | Other (GM's choice) |\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Class-specific-rules/Mutagens-Alchemist":{"title":"","content":"MUTAGENS\nMutagens alter the alchemist's form, increasing his physique for one hour at the cost of mental impairment.\nBrewing a mutagen costs an hour's work and two Power Points but no arcane skill roll.

Members are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order. Names of these orders might vary depending on the region. A cavalier gains his order's Order Ability upon taking the appropriate Edge.\n\n### ORDER OF THE COCKATRICE\nA cavalier who belongs to this order serves only himself, working to further his own aims and increase his personal prestige.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must keep his own interests and aims above those of all others. He must always accept payment when it is due, rewards when earned, and an even (or greater) share of loot when possible. The cavalier must take every opportunity to increase his own stature, prestige, and power.\n - **CHALLENGE:** The cavalier adds +2 damage to Fighting attacks made against the target of his challenge.\n - **ORDER ABILITY (Steal Glory):** Once per round, when an ally targets a foe within the cavalier's Reach, the cavalier may make a free attack against the same target.\n\n### ORDER OF THE DRAGON\nCavaliers belonging to the order of the dragon dedicate themselves to a group of like-minded individuals, be it a mercenary company or a small band of adventurers. They believe in loyalty and friendship, and are willing to lay down their lives to protect their allies.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must remain loyal to his allies and always work to further the aims of the group. He must protect his allies from harm and defend their honor when called into doubt.\n - **CHALLENGE:** As a limited action, the cavalier grants his allies a +2 bonus on Fighting rolls against the target of his challenge until the end of the round.\n - **ORDER ABILITY (Aid Allies):** Whenever an order of the dragon cavalier Supports an ally, the ally also receives the Support bonus to their Parry for the rest of the round.\n\n### ORDER OF THE LION\nA cavalier who belongs to this order has pledged himself to a sovereign; be it a king, queen, or even the local warlord. They are stalwart and dedicated to their cause, willing to go to any length to ensure the safety of their lord and his domain.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must protect the life and lands of his sovereign at all costs. He must obey his lord's commands without question and strive to expand the power and prestige of his realm.\n - **CHALLENGE:** The target of the cavalier's challenge is Distracted as long as the cavalier is within 10\" (20 yards).\n - **ORDER ABILITY (Shield of the Liege):** A selfless lion cavalier may redirect a melee or ranged attack made against an adjacent ally to himself. This ability can be used any number of times per day but must be declared before the attack roll is made.\n\n### ORDER OF THE SHIELD\nCavaliers who join the order of the shield devote their lives to protecting the common folk, from the simple farmer to the honest craftsman. These cavaliers stand before the tide, protecting the innocent from roving marauders and hungry monsters.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must protect the lives and prosperity of the common folk, shielding them from the deprivations of any who would cause them harm or exploit them. He must give charity when it is warranted and aid where needed. He must take no action that would cause harm or hardship to those who cannot defend themselves.\n - **CHALLENGE:** Whenever an order of the shield cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +2 bonus on opposed Tests with the target of his challenge.\n - **ORDER ABILITY (Stem the Tide):** Once per round when an enemy enters Reach of one of his weapons the cavalier may make a free and cannot move any further this round.\n\n### ORDER OF THE STAR\nCavaliers who join the order of the star dedicate themselves to the protection and service of a faith and its members (chosen when this Edge is selected). Thereafter they tend to following many of the tenets and guides of the religion they serve.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must strive to protect the faith and all those who follow its teachings, from priest to common person.

They tend to swear service to a lord or a lady, or sometimes to a creature of renown.\nOf all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.\n - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.\n - **CHALLENGE:** The cavalier gets a free reroll on failed Fighting rolls against the target of his challenge.\n - **ORDER ABILITY (Mounted Mastery):** Cavaliers eventually learn to turn the long reach of pole-arms and other weapons designed to defeat horsemen against their wielders. Whenever a mounted cavalier makes a charge attack, he adds his mount‚Äôs Strength roll to the damage (rather than the usual +4 charge bonus for mounted attacks, see Mounted Combat in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds).","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.347210096Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Class-specific-rules/Spellbooks-Wizard":{"title":"","content":"### SPELLBOOKS\nWizard spells are strange, complex things that fade quickly from the minds of even the most accomplished casters.

If a wizard doesn‚Äôt have access to his spellbook, he may continue to cast normally until the next sunset or sunrise (whichever comes first). After that, the magical imprint on his mind fades and he can no longer cast them.\nWizards may only carry one active spellbook at a time. The mountains of scrolls, magical notations, and research needed to prepare another cannot be carried with the wizard and must be stored safely somewhere. It takes a week of work and 500 gp to create a replacement spellbook once the wizard has access to his magical notes.\nWhen a wizard takes the New Powers Edge, he chooses any two powers as usual.

While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than casting spells like a sorcerer or wizard, an alchemist captures arcane essences within strange liquids and extracts, infusing mysterious concoctions with spell-like abilities, combustible energy, and transformative mutagens.\n - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Alchemist):** Alchemists use Alchemy as their arcane skill. This gives them 10 Power Points and two powers from the list below. Available Powers: Arcane protection, boost/ lower Trait, burst, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, environmental protection, fly, growth/shrink, healing, invisibility, intangibility, magic jar, protection, relief, shape change, speak language, speed, wall walker, warrior's gift.\n - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Light):** While wearing medium or heavy armor or using medium or heavy shields, the character's Alchemy rolls suffer a ‚àí4 penalty. The hero cannot use other abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.\n - **ALCHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION:** An alchemist can use Alchemy to identify a potion as if using detect arcana.\n - **BOMBS AND MUTAGENS:** Alchemists may create bombs and mutagens with their chemicals and reagents. See [[content/swpf/Class specific rules/Bombs (Alchemist)]] and [[content/swpf/Class specific rules/Mutagens (Alchemist)]].\n - **EXTRACTS:** Potions are permanent magic items such as those listed in the Magic Items chapter of Pathfinder for Savage Worlds. Extracts are temporary concoctions imbued with powers and use the creator's Alchemy skill. They behave like spells, and can be dispelled by effects like dispel. \nExtracts are prepared \"off camera,\" requiring an hour's time, the alchemist's formulae book, and an alchemist's kit. The alchemist doesn't spend any Power Points until he activates the power. Without his formulae book, he may cast as usual but cannot refresh his \"supplies\" (his Power Points do not recharge).\nAll of the alchemist's powers except burst and damage field with a Range greater than Touch must take the Touch Limitation (since extracts must be consumed or applied to be used). The Power Point cost is reduced as usual. The templates for burst and damage field (with the Area of Effect modifiers) emanate from the character who imbibed the extract, but the alchemist still makes the arcane skill roll.\n\n# Discovery \nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Alchemist \nThe alchemist makes an incredible revelation. Select one Discovery from those listed [[content/swpf/Class specific rules/Discoveries (Alchemist)#DISCOVERIES|here]]. This Edge may be taken once per Rank.\n\n# Advanced Discovery\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Alchemist\nThe alchemist makes a great advance in his knowledge of science and chemistry.

In the ways of their people, in the fury of their passion, in the howl of battle, these brutal souls swear by the creed of conflict. Battle possessed, these savage warriors disdain the life of the professional guard or soldier. They seek to fight for the sake of the act itself. Known as barbarians, these warmongers know little of tactics, preparation, or the rules of warfare. For them, only the moment exists. They embrace the possibility that the next battle might hold their death. Within the barbarian‚Äôs heart beats the primal spirit of struggle. Those who face their rage, beware.\n -  **ARMOR RESTRICTION (Medium):** A barbarian‚Äôs fighting style requires great freedom of movement. They subtract 4 from Agility and Agility-based skill rolls when wearing heavy armor or using a heavy shield.\n -  **FAST:** Barbarians are fast and durable runners. They increase their base Pace by +2. This doesn‚Äôt affect their running die, but does stack with Edges like Fleet-Footed or ancestral modifiers.\n - **RAGE:** Barbarians can call upon inner reserves of strength and ferocity in desperate circumstances. As a limited free action, a barbarian may ‚Äúrage‚Äù voluntarily. If she‚Äôs Shaken or Wounded, she must make a Smarts roll or rage whether she wants to or not.\nRage lasts five rounds. After the barbarian‚Äôs fifth turn raging, she takes a level of Fatigue that can only be recovered with an hour‚Äôs rest (generally no walking, riding, etc). An Exhausted barbarian who rages is Incapacitated afterward. See page 132 for more on Fatigue.\nWhile raging, a barbarian gains the following abilities:\n -- **Fury:** Her Strength increases a die type (ignoring her usual maximum) and every attack must be a Wild Attack (see page 141). She can‚Äôt use any skill or ability that requires more than a few seconds of concentration (GM‚Äôs call).\n --  **Enraged:** She ignores two points of Wound penalties and all Fatigue penalties (this stacks with any other abilities that reduce those penalties).\n  --  **Reckless Abandon:** If a barbarian rolls a Critical Failure on an attack roll while raging, she hits a random target within range of her attack (not the intended target), friend or foe. If there are no applicable targets, she injures herself and suffers Bumps \u0026 Bruises (see page 151).\n  \n# Powerful Blow\nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Barbarian\nThe barbarian's savage Wild Attacks cause +4 damage instead of +2. See Wild Attacks on page 141.\n\n# Intimidating Glare\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Barbarian\nThe fearsome and baleful gaze of the wild barbarian unsettles all but the stoutest souls. When the barbarian‚Äôs Action Card is a Jack or higher, she may make an Intimidation roll as a limited free action. She also ignores the usual advice on Repetition (see page 140). She may issue threats and insults if she wants, but her terrible glare is often enough to send shivers down her foes' spines. \n\n# DISRUPTIVE RAGE (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Barbarian, Spirit d8+, Occult d6+\nSuperstitious barbarians hone their martial prowess against spellcasters. This rampaging mage-killer gets a free attack against any enemy who casts a spell or miracle within her Reach.\nMagic items don't normally trigger this ability unless they allow the user to cast a spell, miracle, or power of some sort.\n\n# Strength Surge\nREQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Barbarian\nThe barbarian‚Äôs rage knows no bounds!

They bolster their allies in dire circumstances, beguile their enemies, and often battle evil with a sword in one hand and a lute in the other.\nBards cast spells by singing, reciting poetry, or reciting epic tales. They are usually erudite individuals, traveling the land to learn bawdy songs, great histories, and epic legends.\nAllies must be able to hear the bard to benefit from his various abilities.\n - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Bard):** Bards use Performance as their arcane skill. They have 3 starting powers and 10 Power Points. Available Powers: *Arcane protection, banish, beast friend, boost/lower Trait, confusion, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, conjure item, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, empathy, fear, healing, illusion, mind link, mind reading, object reading, puppet, sloth/speed, slumber, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, teleport, warrior‚Äôs gift.*\n - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Light)**: Bulky armor interferes with a bard‚Äôs grace and dexterity. They subtract 4 from their Performance rolls and from their Agility and Agility based skill rolls if using medium or heavy armor or shields.\n - **SHARP TONGUED:** Bards may use Performance as Taunt to Test a foe. They may also ignore the Repetition advice given under Tests (see page 140), as long as they recite different verses, stanzas, lyrics, etc. Bards may also substitute Performance for Taunt to meet Edge Requirements.\n\n# Inspire Heroics\nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Bard\nBards inspire their comrades with epic tales of valor and bravery. Once during any combat encounter (GM‚Äôs call), the bard can spend a Benny to gain five Inspiration tokens. This is a limited free action.\nFor the remainder of the encounter, the bard may give these tokens to anyone within a Range of Smarts except himself. This may be done at any time (as long as the bard is conscious). The recipient must use the token immediately‚Äîit cannot be saved.\nEach Inspiration token allows a character to reroll a Trait or damage roll. A Trait or damage roll may only benefit from a single Inspiration Token, even if there are multiple bards present. Further rerolls require spending a Benny or a special ability.\nInspiration tokens aren‚Äôt Bennies, don‚Äôt trigger Edges that use Bennies (such as Elan), and can‚Äôt be used as such in any other way such as drawing new Action Cards or Soaking Wounds.\n\n# INSPIRE GREATNESS (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Bard, Inspire Heroics\nThe bard gains an additional three Inspiration Tokens when he uses Inspire Heroics.\n\n# Countersong\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Bard\nThe bard and all allies within 5‚Äù (10 yards) get a free reroll when opposing enemy spell effects or attempting to recover from them. This includes rolls to recover from any magical effect as blind, lower Trait, or stun. Countersong doesn‚Äôt help targets resist or recover from natural effects.\n\n# Dirge of Doom\nREQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Bard\nThis baleful song builds dread in the bard‚Äôs foes. At his discretion, any enemy who spends a Benny to Soak or reroll a Trait or damage roll within 10‚Äù (20 yards) and line of sight of the bard subtracts 2 from the final total.\n\n# DEADLY PERFORMANCE (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Bard Edges\nThe bard can use his Performance to Incapacitate a foe from extreme joy or sorrow. Deadly Performance may only be attempted once per encounter. The target must be able to see, hear, and understand the bard and be within 5\" (10 yards).\nWhen he decides to unleash his deadly display, he makes a Performance roll opposed by the target's Spirit.

See page 45 for how the cavalier's mount works.\n - **CHALLENGE:** As a limited action, a cavalier can issue a challenge to an opponent he can see and is within 24\" (48 yards). The challenge remains in effect until the target is defeated, the cavalier is Incapacitated, or the combat ends, and he may never challenge more than one enemy at a time. The effects of the challenge can be found under each of the Cavalier Orders beginning on page 44.\n - **MIGHTY CHARGE:** The cavalier increases his melee weapon's damage die one die type on a turn in which he moves towards an enemy while mounted.\n - **ORDER:** A cavalier must pledge himself to an order of like-minded individuals. This gives him a Minor Vow to serve the order that doesn't grant additional Hindrance points. If a cavalier violates his order's edicts (GM's call), he loses the benefits of all Cavalier Edges for 24 hours.\nThe list of orders, their edicts, and the benefits they grant are listed on page 44.

Mysteries, and wonders of arcane realms call to those with the ambition‚Äîand the intellect‚Äîto grasp true power. Such is the path of the wizard. These magic-users research, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge. Some choose to become a master of a particular field of magic.\nOthers embrace versatility, revelling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.\n - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Wizard):** Wizards use Spellcasting as their arcane skill. A hero who takes this Edge gains 10 Power Points and three powers from the list below. Available Powers: Arcane protection, baleful polymorph, banish, barrier, beast friend, blast, blind, bolt, boost/lower Trait, burrow, burst, confusion, conjure item, curse, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation, empathy, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fear, fly, growth/shrink, havoc, illusion, intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness, locate, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, object reading, planar binding, plane shift, protection, puppet, scrying, shape change, sloth/speed, slumber, smite, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, telekinesis, teleport, time stop, wall walker, warrior‚Äôs gift, wish, zombie.\n - **ARCANE BOND:** Wizards form an intense magical bond with an object or creature. See Arcane Bond, below.\n - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Any):** Like sorcerers, wizards must gesticulate in precise patterns. They subtract 4 from their Spellcasting rolls and from their Agility and Agility-based skill rolls if using light, medium, or heavy armor or shields.\n - **SCHOOL:** A wizard‚Äôs studies lead him down one of two paths‚Äîthe ‚Äúuniversalist‚Äù who dabbles in all the various ‚Äúschools‚Äù of magic, or a ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù who focuses on one school at the expense of some others. Specialists must choose one favored school and two opposition schools from the list on page 174. They gain a free reroll on arcane skill rolls to cast spells (not activating an item) from their favored school, but spells cast from their opposition school cost one additional Power Point and suffer a ‚àí2 penalty to the wizard's arcane skill roll. Wizards mark favored spells in their power lists in bold and opposition spells with an asterisk, like this: shape change, banish*.\n - **SPELLBOOKS:** Wizards must keep and maintain spellbooks (see page 70).\n\nARCANE BOND\nWizards immerse themselves in the study of eldritch lore and arcane theories. During these long hours they form a bond with a dependable item or friendly creature (a ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù). Choose one of the following options for your wizard:\n - **BONDED OBJECT:** The spellcaster possesses an amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon that adds +1 to all his Spellcasting totals when worn or in hand. If the object is lost or destroyed, the mage can replace it with a new object worth at least 500 gp.\n - **FAMILIAR:** The mage has a magical pet. See the sidebar on page 70.\n\n# FAVORED POWERS (WIZARD)\nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Wizard\nThe wizard has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action, he may ignore up to two points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting arcane protection, deflection, dispel. This Edge doesn‚Äôt give him those powers‚Äî they must be taken separately.\n\n# FAVORED POWERS (CHOOSE ONE) (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Sorcerer or Wizard\nThe spellcaster has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action, he may ignore up to 2 points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting any one of the spell sets below. This Edge may be taken multiple times, choosing a different set each time. This Edge doesn‚Äôt give him those powers‚Äî they must be taken separately.\n - **ABJURER:** Banish, environmental protection, or protection.\n - **CONJURER:** Barrier, create pit, or summon ally.\n - **DIVINER:** Detect arcana, locate, or scrying.\n - **ENCHANTER:** Beast friend, empathy, or mind wipe.\n - **EVOKER:** Blast or burst (choose one), havoc, or stun.\n - **ILLUSIONIST:** Conceal arcana, illusion, or invisibility.\n - **NECROMANCER:** Blind, drain Power Points, or fear.\n - **TRANSMUTER:** Elemental manipulation, shape change, or telekinesis.\n\n# ARCANE MASTERY\nREQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Wizard\nTrue understanding of magical energy comes with practice and experience. Wizards who take this Edge gain access to all their powers‚Äô Epic Power Modifiers (see Powers in Chapter Five).\n\n# ELDRITCH INSPIRATION\nREQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Wizard\nGreat wizards gather esoteric information in their spellbooks, allowing them to harness magical powers at a whim. Assuming he has his spellbook on his person, the wizard can spend a Benny to cast any power of his Rank or lower. The power may be maintained normally but afterwards is forgotten (the wizard doesn‚Äôt add it to his list of powers).\n\n# WELL PREPARED (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Wizard Edges\nThe wizard may activate a power that can normally be cast as an action as a limited free action. This costs an additional Power Point, but not only allows the wizard to cast a spell each round without incurring a Multi-Action penalty, she may also cast it while Shaken or affected by some other condition that only allows free actions.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-10-14T09:53:10.351210131Z","tags":null},"/swpf/Edges/Class/z.-Unclassed":{"title":"","content":"# EXTRA DOMAIN (APG)\nREQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (Miracles) or Cleric\nThis cleric's deity smiles down upon her, granting divine strength.

One person can fire the device (Shooting). One person can reload, although it‚Äôs faster with two people.\nA ram is a movable scaffold with a heavy wooden pole suspended by rope or chains. A crew of at least two is needed to swing the ram pole to batter another object. Up to eight people can swing the ram, with the leader making the attack roll and others providing Support.\nA siege tower is a massive wooden tower on wheels, designed for scaling walls. Moving the structure requires at least a crew of eight, who can push the device at Pace 1 from within the tower on the ground (double that if 16 individuals push the tower, and triple it if 24 push). Those within have complete cover and solid wooden walls until the ramp drops, usually at the highest level.

A simple success on a Stealth roll means the character avoids detection if enemies aren‚Äôt particularly alert. If the character fails the roll, the enemy realizes something is amiss and begins actively searching for whatever roused them.\nOnce foes are alerted and active, Stealth is opposed by Notice (a group roll if there are many foes, see page 119).\nThe GM should apply any circumstantial penalties to Notice rolls for darkness, cover, noise, distractions, and any difference in the target‚Äôs Scale (just like when attacking, see Scale on page 138). Sneaking through dry leaves might subtract 2 from the Stealth roll, for example, while spotting someone in the dark uses the Illumination penalty listed on page 134 (‚àí4). Don‚Äôt apply the same modifier to both rolls, however. If Stealth is at ‚àí2 for the leaves, don‚Äôt give Notice a +2 for them as well. \n**Attacking from Stealth:** Sneaking up close enough to make a melee attack always requires an opposed Stealth roll versus the target‚Äôs Notice, whether the guard is actively looking for trouble or not.\nIf successful, the attacker is considered on Hold (page 134) and the victim is Vulnerable (page 132) to him (but not others) until the attacker‚Äôs turn ends (not the defender‚Äôs in this case). With a raise, the attacker has The Drop (page 132) instead.\nBefore the attacker strikes, the defender and any other beings on his side must check for Surprise (see page 139). The attacker may come off Hold and resolve his strike; then the rest of the round progresses normally.\n**Movement:** In combat, characters roll Stealth each turn as a free action at the end of their move or any action the GM thinks might draw attention.\nOut of combat, the distance moved depends entirely on the situation.
