They seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves’ long lifespans. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than bending it to their will. Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted, the resulting alliances can last for generations. Elves take joy in forging alliances with those that share or exceed their long lifetimes, and often work to befriend dragons, outsiders, and fey. Those who spend their lives among the short-lived, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions die before their eyes.</p><a href=#physical-description><h3 id=physical-description><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h3></a><p>Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique. It is a mistake to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves varies wildly as their coloration often matches their surroundings. Although, elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones. Elves’ bodies change over time, taking on a physical representation of their mental and spiritual states. Additionally, those who dwell in a region for a long period of time find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, such as taking on coloration that reflects the local environment.</p><a href=#society><h3 id=society><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>SOCIETY</h3></a><p>Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. When driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region’s bounty, and learn how to maximize what can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather. Most find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery. When such work must be done, regardless of their craftsmanship, such “dirt-wrights” are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Arcane research and accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise lavished upon elven wizards.</p><p><strong>Relations:</strong> Elves are prone to writing off outsiders as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another culture, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing their ancestry as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn’t understand why his “special friend” is upset the elf has noticed the friend is “so much better than the rest of his kind.” Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking. Elves are not foolish enough to dismiss all aspects of other cultures. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge dwarves’ skill at smithing and their tenacity in facing orc threats. Elves regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, but regard their magical talent as being worthy of praise and respect. Halflings are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, who seem to live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any sort and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion.</p><p><strong>Religion:</strong> Elves prefer deities who share their love of the mystic qualities of the world—Desna and Nethys are particular favorites, the former for her wonder and love of the wild places, and the latter for his mastery of magic. Calistria is perhaps the most notorious of elven deities, for she represents elven ideals taken to an extreme. Elves accept in Calistria (and her priests) behavior they would denounce in others, because Calistria is clearly (to elves’ perceptions) serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification.</p><a href=#adventurers><h3 id=adventurers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ADVENTURERS</h3></a><p>Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten magic or search out lost kingdoms. This need is accepted as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. For elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes—watching friends and family swiftly age and die—is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> Common and Elven.
<strong>Age Range:</strong> Adult 115, old age, 263, max age 350-750.
<strong>Elf Males:</strong> Height 5'6-6'8 and weight 116-158 (Average 6'1" , 127 lbs).
<strong>Elf Females:</strong> Height 5'6"-6'4" and weight 96-126 (Average 6'1", 117 lbs).</p><ul><li><p><strong>AGILE:</strong> Elves are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>ELVEN MAGIC:</strong> Elves have an inherent connection to arcane energies. Elves get a free reroll when rolling to resist enemy powers.</p></li><li><p><strong>INTELLIGENCE:</strong> Elves are highly intelligent and long-lived. They start with a d6 in Smarts instead of a d4. This increases maximum Smarts to d12 + 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>KEEN SENSES:</strong> Elves start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases their maximum Notice to d12 + 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>LOW LIGHT VISION:</strong> Elven eyes amplify light. Others often claim they can see stars in the elves’ eyes. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.</p></li><li><p><strong>SLENDER:</strong> Slight of build and less robust than others, elves suffer −1 Toughness and –1 to Vigor rolls.</p></li></ul><a href=#alternate-ancestral-abilities><h4 id=alternate-ancestral-abilities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES</h4></a><ul><li><p><strong>DESERT RUNNER:</strong> Some elves thrive in deserts, forever roaming across burned and parched lands. These elves get a free reroll to avoid Fatigue, Exhaustion, or other ill effects from forced marches, starvation, thirst, or hot or cold environments. This replaces Elven Magic.</p></li><li><p><strong>DREAMSPEAKER:</strong> A few elves have the ability to tap into the power of sleep, dreams, and prescient reverie. An elf with this ability adds +1 to rolls made to resist suffering Fatigue from lack of sleep. In addition, each night the elf can send his consciousness into the mind of a dreamer he knows. The character can deliver a message before returning to his body. The recipient remembers the message perfectly upon waking up. This replaces Keen Senses.</p></li><li><p><strong>URBANITE:</strong> Elves living in cities for more than a century learn the ebb and flow of social situations. These elves get a free reroll when Networking.
