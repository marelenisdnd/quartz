PERSUASION (SPIRIT)
Persuasion is the ability to convince others to do what you want through reason, cajoling, deception, rewards, or other friendly means. Persuasion isn’t mind control. It can change someone’s attitude but not their goals. A bandit may let you keep a sentimental piece of jewelry with a good Persuasion roll but still takes all your other goods.
When used to Support allies (page 138) it’s an unopposed roll. If the target is resistant, it’s an opposed roll vs. the target’s Spirit. The GM should modify the roll as appropriate based on roleplaying, any pertinent Edges or Hindrances that affect the conversation, and the circumstances.
**Reaction Level:** How much a person is willing to cooperate depends largely on their attitude toward whoever’s talking to them. The Game Master can decide how nonplayer characters feel based on the setting, or roll on the [[Reaction Table]]  when having no preconceived notions.
Success improves the target’s attitude one level and a raise improves it two. Further increases aren’t generally possible in the same encounter—it takes individuals a little time to adjust their biases.
Failure means the target won’t change his mind this encounter or until the situation changes in some important way. A Critical Failure also reduces the target’s attitude two levels.
Only one roll should generally be allowed per interaction unless new information is revealed, a substantial reward is offered, etc.
**Networking:** Characters can also use Persuasion as a “macro skill,” simulating a few hours or an evening’s time hobnobbing and socializing to gain favors or information. See Networking on page 160.
