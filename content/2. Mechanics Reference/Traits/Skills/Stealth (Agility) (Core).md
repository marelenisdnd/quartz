STEALTH (AGILITY)
Stealth is the ability to hide and move quietly. A simple success on a Stealth roll means the character avoids detection if enemies aren’t particularly alert. If the character fails the roll, the enemy realizes something is amiss and begins actively searching for whatever roused them.
Once foes are alerted and active, Stealth is opposed by Notice (a group roll if there are many foes, see page 119).
The GM should apply any circumstantial penalties to Notice rolls for darkness, cover, noise, distractions, and any difference in the target’s Scale (just like when attacking, see Scale on page 138). Sneaking through dry leaves might subtract 2 from the Stealth roll, for example, while spotting someone in the dark uses the Illumination penalty listed on page 134 (−4). Don’t apply the same modifier to both rolls, however. If Stealth is at −2 for the leaves, don’t give Notice a +2 for them as well. 
**Attacking from Stealth:** Sneaking up close enough to make a melee attack always requires an opposed Stealth roll versus the target’s Notice, whether the guard is actively looking for trouble or not.
If successful, the attacker is considered on Hold (page 134) and the victim is Vulnerable (page 132) to him (but not others) until the attacker’s turn ends (not the defender’s in this case). With a raise, the attacker has The Drop (page 132) instead.
Before the attacker strikes, the defender and any other beings on his side must check for Surprise (see page 139). The attacker may come off Hold and resolve his strike; then the rest of the round progresses normally.
**Movement:** In combat, characters roll Stealth each turn as a free action at the end of their move or any action the GM thinks might draw attention.
Out of combat, the distance moved depends entirely on the situation. The GM might want a roll every minute if the group is sneaking around the perimeter of a defensive position, or every few miles if they’re trying to quietly walk through a dark forest without alerting the creatures that live there.
