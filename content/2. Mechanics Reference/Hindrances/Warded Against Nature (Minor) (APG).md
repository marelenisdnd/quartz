WARDED AGAINST NATURE (MINOR)
Animals find your character particularly unnerving. Even the most well trained animals require coaxing to work with you.
Animals do not willingly approach within 10" (20 yards) of you unless persuaded. In addition, the hero suffers a âˆ’2 penalty on rolls to control animals, including Riding (see Animal Handling, below).
