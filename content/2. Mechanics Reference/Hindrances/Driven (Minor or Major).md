DRIVEN (MINOR OR MAJOR)
A vow is a commitment to others—driven characters want something for themselves. It may be to protect the realm, prove you’re the best knucklebones player in the kingdom, or the best equestrian on Golarion.
The Minor version shapes the character and influences decisions but either happens rarely or is fairly harmless. As a Major Hindrance it’s an overriding desire that comes up frequently or causes peril for the hero and companions.
