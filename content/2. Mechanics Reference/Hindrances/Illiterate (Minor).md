ILLITERATE (MINOR)
Your hero can't read. Perhaps he can sign his name or make his mark or recognize a single common word, but little else. He also knows very little math. He can probably figure 2 + 2 = 4, but multiplication and the like are beyond the pale.
Illiterate characters canâ€™t read or write in any language, by the way, no matter how many they actually speak.
