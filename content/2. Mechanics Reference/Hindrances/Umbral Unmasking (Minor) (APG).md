UMBRAL UNMASKING (MINOR)
You cast no shadow whatsoever, or the shadow you do have is monstrous. Under normal lighted conditions, this is not hard to observeâ€”but uncommon to notice.
Anyone who notices this character's shadow has a worse initial reaction to the character (see Persuasion in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds).
