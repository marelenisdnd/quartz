OBLIGATION (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Your hero has a responsibility he attends to on a regular basis. He might have a job, volunteer at the local temple, take care of friends or family, and so on.
The Obligation consumes about 20 hours most weeks, or 40+ for the Major version. Exactly what that entails should be discussed between the player and the Game Master.
