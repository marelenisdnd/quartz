QUIRK (MINOR)
This individual has some minor foible that is usually humorous but can occasionally cause real trouble. A swashbuckler may always try to slash a mark on foes, a dwarf may brag constantly about dwarven culture, or a snobby d√©butante might not eat, drink, or socialize with the lower class, for example.
