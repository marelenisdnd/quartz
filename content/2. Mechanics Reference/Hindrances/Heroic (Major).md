HEROIC (MAJOR)
This noble soul never says no to a person in need. She doesn’t have to be happy about it, but will always come to the rescue of those who can’t help themselves. She's the first one to run into a burning building, usually agrees to hunt monsters for little or no pay, and is generally a pushover for a sob story.
