# Aasimar

![[Aasimar.png|right|200]]

Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. 

Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. “It’s always the one you least suspect” is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule. 

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 
Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos. 

### SOCIETY 
Aasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. 

While corrupt aasimars may be loners or establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders. 

**Relations:** It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than in those of a different heritage, though it may be that humanity’s inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars. Perhaps the endemic traits of other ancestries are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances non-humans may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true. Even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable.

They get on well with half-elves, who share a similar not-quitehuman marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with half-orcs, who have no patience for aasimars’ overly pretty words and faces. Elven courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known ancestries, gnomes find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage. 

**Religion:** For the most part, aasimars favor deities of honor, valor, protection, healing, and refuge, or simple and prosaic faiths of home, community, and family. Some also follow the paths of art, music, and lore, finding truth and wisdom in beauty and learning.
