# HALF-ELVES
Since the two first came into contact with each other, humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in these fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, and are drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which they play out their brief lives. Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually shortlived, even by human standards, such trysts may lead to the birth of half-elves, an ancestry descended from two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves alike. Caught between destiny and derision, half-elves often view themselves as the middle children of the world.
### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.

### SOCIETY
Their lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to elves and humans, half-elves rarely fit in with either. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. Even half-elves welcomed by one side of their heritage often find themselves caught between cultures, as they are encouraged, cajoled into taking on diplomatic responsibilities between humans and elves.
**Relations:** Half-elves understand loneliness, and know that character is often less a product of their bloodline than of life experience. As such, they are less likely than most to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances. Those humans who admire elvenkind see half-elves as a living link or bridge between the two. But this attitude often foists unfair expectations upon half-elves, and quickly turns to derision when they do not live up to the destinies others set for them. Additionally, half-elves raised by or in the company of elves often have the human half of their parentage dubbed as something to overcome. Among other cultures, half-elves form unique and often unexpected bonds. Dwarves, despite their traditional mistrust of elves, see a half-elf’s human parentage as something hopeful, and treat them as half-humans rather than half-elves. Additionally, the lifespan of dwarves is closer to a half-elf’s own than that of either of her parents. As a result, half-elves and dwarves often form lasting bonds. Gnomes and halflings often see half-elves as a curiosity. Those half-elves who have seen themselves pushed to the edges of society, truly without a home, typically find gnomes and halflings frivolous and worthy of disdain, but secretly envy their seemingly carefree ways. Clever and enterprising gnomes and halflings sometimes partner with a half-elf for adventures or even business ventures, using the half-elf’s participation to lend their own endeavors an air of legitimacy that they cannot acquire on their own. Perhaps the most peculiar and dichotomous relations exist between half-elves and half-orcs. Those halforcs and half-elves who were raised among their non-human kin normally see one another as hated and ancient foes. Half-elves who have been marginalized by society feel a deep, almost instant kinship with half-orcs, knowing their burdens are often that much harder because of their appearance and somewhat brutish nature. Not all half-orcs are inclined or able to understand such empathy, but those who do often find themselves with a dedicated diplomat, liaison, and apologist. For their own part, half-orcs usually return the favor by acting as bodyguards and take on other roles suited to their brawny forms.
**Religion:** Half-elves’ lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland. Some half-elves feel the pull of the divine but live beyond the formal religious instruction of society. Such individuals often worship ideas and concepts like freedom, harmony, balance, or the primal forces of the world. Still others gravitate toward long-forgotten gods, finding comfort and kinship in the idea that even deities can be overlooked.

### ADVENTURERS
Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering in search of a place to call home. The desire to prove themselves to the community and establish a personal identity—or even a legacy— drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery. Despite their longevity, some half-elves claim they perceive the passage of time more like humans than elves, and are driven to amass wealth, power, or fame early on in life so they may spend the rest of their years enjoying it.

 - **ELVEN MAGIC:** Half-elves have an inherent connection to arcane energies. They get a free reroll when rolling to resist enemy powers. 

 - **FLEXIBILITY:** Half-elves start with a d6 in any one Attribute instead of a d4. This does not increase the attribute maximum. 

 - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Half-elven eyes amplify light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination.


#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES

 - DROW MAGIC: A few half-elves with drow ancestry exhibit the innate magic of their ancestors. They have 1 Power Point and can cast darkness, using their Smarts (or arcane skill if they have one) to activate this power. This replaces Elven Magic.

 - WARY: Many half-elves have spent their long lives moving from place to place, often driven out by the hostility of others. Such experiences have made them wary of others’ motivations. These half elves get a free reroll when deceiving others or attempting to detect when they are being deceived. They gain the Suspicious (Minor) Hindrance, but not any Hindrance points.
