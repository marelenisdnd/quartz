Below are the bloodlines available to sorcerers. Many grant various forms of environmental resistance—you'll find those rules on page 241.
ABERRANT
A bizarre and alien legacy taints the sorcerer’s blood. Her strange form increases her Toughness by +1. Bolt, blast, and burst spells must be cast with the Lingering Damage Power Modifier (page 170), but cost the sorcerer only 1 additional Power Point instead of 2.
Finally, her long limbs give her Reach +1. In addition to allowing the sorcerer to attack at a distance, this can be used for determining a spell’s Range or origin.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The character is never Surprised and is immune to the Drop unless Bound. Her alien form grants her another point of Toughness.

ABYSSAL
Generations ago, a demon corrupted the hero’s heritage. She has environmental resistance to electricity, +1 Toughness, and sharp claws that cause Str+d4 damage.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The abyssal can conjure demons to aid her. The cost for summon ally is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 1), and the entities summoned cause Fear. She also gains environmental resistance to cold and fire.

ARCANE
The sorcerer forms a magical bond with a creature or an object. Use the rules for the wizard’s Arcane Bond found on page 68.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The sorcerer’s connection to magic is incredibly strong. She gets a free reroll on any failed Spellcasting roll.

CELESTIAL
A celestial ancestor or divine intervention of some sort blessed this hero’s bloodline. Her bolt, blast, and burst spells cause +2 damage to evil creatures (this stacks with Champion). She also gains environmental resistance to cold and acid.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The celestial can extend or hide angel-like wings as a free action. While extended, she gains Flight at Pace 12.

DESTINED
The character is destined for great things. She gains one additional Benny per session.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The hero starts with two extra Bennies per session.

DRACONIC
There’s a dragon lurking somewhere in the family tree. Its scion gains claws (Str+d4), scaly skin (Armor +2), and +1 damage to powers with trappings suitable to her draconic bloodline.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The sorcerer’s claws now add AP +2 and she gains environmental resistance common to her bloodline (acid for black, fire for red, etc.).

ELEMENTAL
The mage’s family was touched by a powerful elemental force. Choose one of the elements listed below. Your hero gains environmental resistance to that element and one of the following abilities:
• Air: Flight, Pace 6.
• Earth: Burrowing Pace 6 (page 178).
• Fire: +2 damage to damaging Powers with a fire Trapping.
• Water: Enemies are automatically Hindered (per the modifier) when affected by your powers.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** Once per encounter, you can unleash an elemental blast as an action. This causes 3d6 damage, uses the Cone Template, and may be Evaded.

FEY
The capricious nature of the fey runs in this sorcerer’s family. She ignores Difficult Terrain in the wilderness and has the “laughing touch.” If she successfully touches a target with her hands (see Touch Attacks, page 140), the target is Distracted.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** Victims of a fey’s spell with a lingering effect, such as blind, lower Trait, stun, and the like, subtract 2 from any roll made to recover.

INFERNAL
A relative made a deal with dark forces in the distant past. The character gains environmental resistance to fire, immunity to poison, and adds +1 to the damage of any attack powers with a fire Trapping.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The infernal grows or hides giant bat wings as a free action. Her wings grant her Flight at Pace 12.

UNDEAD
The taint of the grave runs through the character’s bloodline. She gains environmental resistance to cold and a +1 to Soak rolls.
 - **ADVANCED FORM:** The sorcerer is truly undead. She gains the full Undead ability and the Outsider (Major) and Ugly (Major) Hindrance. The heroine might actually be attractive but she’s still disturbing to the living!
