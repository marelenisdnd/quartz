### SPELLBOOKS
Wizard spells are strange, complex things that fade quickly from the minds of even the most accomplished casters. For this reason, each wizard maintains a spellbook with the spells he’s translated and acquired. He studies them daily, transcribing their mystical patterns onto his mind.
The link to the book is far more than rote memorization—it is an arcane bond with the power and patterns within. If a wizard doesn’t have access to his spellbook, he may continue to cast normally until the next sunset or sunrise (whichever comes first). After that, the magical imprint on his mind fades and he can no longer cast them.
Wizards may only carry one active spellbook at a time. The mountains of scrolls, magical notations, and research needed to prepare another cannot be carried with the wizard and must be stored safely somewhere. It takes a week of work and 500 gp to create a replacement spellbook once the wizard has access to his magical notes.
When a wizard takes the New Powers Edge, he chooses any two powers as usual. If he has found any spells (including scrolls) through exploration or purchase, and it is of his Rank or less, he may take one of those as a bonus third power at that time as well.
