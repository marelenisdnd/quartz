BRUTE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Vigor d6+
Brutes focus on core strength and fitness over coordination and flexibility. They treat Athletics as linked to Strength instead of Agility for purposes of Advancement.  The character may also resist Athletics Tests with Strength if he chooses. 
Finally, Brutes increase the Short Range of any thrown item by +1. Double that for the adjusted Medium Range, and double again for Long Range. If a thrown item’s Range is 3/6/12, for example, a Brute’s Range is 4/8/16.
