BRAWNY
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Vigor d6+
Your bruiser is very large or very fit. Her Size increases by +1 (and therefore Toughness by 1) and she treats her Strength as one die type higher when determining Encumbrance (page 104) and Minimum Strength to use armor, weapons, and equipment without a penalty (page 104).
Brawny can’t increase a character’s Size above +3, and it has no effect on Armor Interference or Armor Restriction.
