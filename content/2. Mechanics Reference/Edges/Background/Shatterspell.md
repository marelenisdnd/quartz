SHATTERSPELL
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Dwarf
With the blessings of your ancestors, your mighty blows shatter your enemy's magic. This character can take a limited action to make a Fighting Test against an opponent with an active power (opposed by the caster's arcane skill). With success, the power is dispelled (as with the dispel power).
