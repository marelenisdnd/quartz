BLOOD DRINKER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Dhampir
The curse in your veins allows you to heal whenever you consume the blood of a mortal.
As a limited action the character can drink the blood of a living Humanoid to immediately make a natural healing roll. This is easier to accomplish when the dhampir has a bite attack.
