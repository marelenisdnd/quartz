# DISRUPTIVE SPELLS
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (Any)
The magical energies from your powers cling to enemies, interfering with their innate abilities.
Targets affected by one of this spellcaster's powers must make a successful Smarts roll to activate any of their Innate Powers or Mystic Powers (rather than the power activating automatically). This effect lasts until the end of the target's next turn.
