# LOREMASTER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Smarts d8+, Academics or Common Knowledge or Occult d8+
A gatherer of secrets and arcane lore, this character values the acquisition of intellectual insights above all else. Often obsessed by the written word, the loremaster knows better than any that knowledge is power.
**Lore:** She gets a free reroll when making Academics, Common Knowledge, Occult, or Science rolls.

# LOREMASTER II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Loremaster
The loremaster gains special insight into those she’s traveled and adventured with. Secret: With the Game Master’s consent, she may take one ability from any core Class Edge she doesn’t already have. She might take the druid’s Wilderness Stride ability, for example, the rogue’s Sneak Attack, or a cleric’s ability to Channel Energy.
This doesn’t confer any other Traits, Edges, or rules required to use the ability.

# LOREMASTER III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Loremaster II
**Greater Lore:** The loremaster learns two new powers from any of those available in the campaign. This may not be useful if a power depends on mechanics the loremaster can’t make use of, but she can still learn the spell if she likes.
