# HOLY VINDICATOR
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Channel Energy ability (such as in the Cleric Class Edge), Occult d6+
Within many faiths are orders of militants who put their lives and immortal souls on the line for their beliefs. With sufficient training, they may become paragons of battle and living conduits of divine power, willing to sacrifice their bodies if it brings glory to their deity or judgment upon enemies of their faith.
**STIGMATA:** A vindicator is marked by scarified wounds appropriate to his deity. He may cause the wounds to bleed for five rounds as a limited free action.
While the stigmata bleed, the vindicator adds +2 to all healing rolls (mundane and magical). Once the stigmata end, the holy vindicator suffers a level of Fatigue.

# HOLY VINDICATOR II
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Holy Vindicator
**BLOODFIRE:** The vindicator's stigmata allow him to add his Spirit die to Fighting damage rolls while bleeding. Additionally, he may now use his Spirit when checking for a weapon's Min Str, allowing him to wield greater burdens in the service of his religion even while his stigmata are not active.

# HOLY VINDICATOR III
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Holy Vindicator II
**BLOODRAIN:** The vindicator surges with sacred energy while bleeding. Doing so activates a minor damage field in a Medium Blast Template centered on the hero with the Selective Power Modifier. Any enemies in the template lose the Hardy special ability.
