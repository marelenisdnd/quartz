# DUELIST
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+
Duelists represent the pinnacle of elegant swordplay, parrying blows and countering their opponent’s actions with expert ripostes.
**Surgical Strike:** A duelist makes surgical strikes with one-handed piercing weapons with a Min Str of d6 or less, adding +2 to her damage total.
**Parry:** If the duelist hasn’t acted this turn, she may declare the Defend maneuver after an opponent declares a Fighting attack against her but before he rolls. She discards her current Action Card and her Parry bonus is +6 instead of +4 that turn.

# DUELIST II
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Duelist
**Crippling Strike:** A foe Shaken or Wounded by the duelist reduces his Pace by 2 until healed. No foe can be subject to more than one crippling strike, and can’t be reduced below a Pace of 1.

# DUELIST III
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Duelist II
**Deflect Arrows:** The duelist can now deflect arrows, bolts, and thrown weapons. Enemies subtract 2 from Athletics (throwing) or Shooting rolls to hit him. This stacks with Dodge and similar abilities, and is ignored if the duelist is surprised, Bound, unaware of the attack, or can’t generally parry the projectiles.
