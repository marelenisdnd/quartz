# DRAGON DISCIPLE
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (any) or Mystic Powers (Any), Occult d6+
Spellcasters who embrace their draconic heritage and learn to channel their abilities become fearsome warriors. They possess not only the repertoire of an accomplished sorcerer, but also the ability to unleash the furious power of dragons upon their foes.
**Breath Attack:** Once per encounter, as a limited action the dragon disciple may make a breath attack in a Cone Template. The attack causes 3d6 damage and may be Evaded. The attack has one of the following effects, based on the type of dragon the character descends from: fire (victims may catch fire, page 154), acid (lingering damage, see page 170), electricity (+2 damage to those in metal armor), or cold (victim is Hindered until the end of his next turn, see page 170).

# DRAGON DISCIPLE II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Dragon Disciple
**Wings:** The dragon disciple’s body becomes more scaly, his eyes more feral, and he may even grow small horns. Eventually, scaly wings sprout from his back, granting him Flight (Pace 8).

# DRAGON DISCIPLE III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Dragon Disciple II
The disciple’s transformation is now complete—this permanently changes her Type to Dragon.
**Dragon Form:** Twice per day as a limited action, the dragon disciple may take the form of a dragon of her bloodline. This makes her Size 3, Strength d12, and Vigor d10. She has Armor 4, and her Bite/Claw attack is Str+d8, AP 2. Her wings grow to accommodate her form.
If she doesn't already have it, her dragon form also grants her environmental resistance common to her draconic heritage (electricity for blue, fire for red, etc.) Her clothing, gear, and magic items meld into her form and provide no benefits. She can remain in this form for up to five minutes, and extend the Duration another five minutes by taking a level of Fatigue. She may still speak and cast spells in dragon form.
