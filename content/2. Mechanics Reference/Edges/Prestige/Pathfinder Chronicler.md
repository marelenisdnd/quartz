# PATHFINDER CHRONICLER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Survival d6+, Common Knowledge or Occult d8+
Brave explorers and seekers of lost or forgotten knowledge, these heroes are quintessential adventurers. They travel the world searching for esoteric truths, magical and mundane relics, and unexplored vistas.
**Pathfinding:** The pathfinder increases the party’s speed by 10% when navigating to known or mapped locations. See Travel on page 165.
She also knows which paths are safest and where to exercise additional caution. If the Game Master is drawing for encounters and gets the Enemies result (see page 165), the chronicler may make a Smarts roll at −2 to discard that card and replace it with the next card in the deck.

# PATHFINDER CHRONICLER II
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Pathfinder Chronicler
**Epic Tales:** The chronicler recites a moving and evocative tale. Once per session, while the party is resting, every Wild Card ally who hears the tale gains a Benny.

# PATHFINDER CHRONICLER III
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Pathfinder Chronicler II
**Call Down the Legends:** Once per game week, the chronicler can magically summon five “shades” of great Golarion heroes who have gone before. The shades assume mortal form, have the profiles in the sidebar at right, and last for one hour.

# Shades
The shades appear as silent, somewhat formless heroes of Golarion — elves, dwarves, humans, and others. They cannot be mistaken for living beings except in the most obscured conditions. They appear from darkness and vanish into it when their time on the mortal realm expires. They are physical while here, and have only a fraction of their true self’s abilities.
