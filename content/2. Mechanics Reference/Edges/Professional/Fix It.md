# FIX IT
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Repair d8+
The hero is a natural with mechanical contraptions. She adds +2 to Repair rolls, and with a raise, halves the time normally required to fix something. This means if a particular Repair job says a raise repairs it in half the time, a Fix It can finish the job in one quarter the time with a raise.
