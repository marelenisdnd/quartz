# WOODSMAN
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d6+, Survival d8+
Woodsmen are rangers, scouts, and hunters who are more at home in the wilderness than urban areas. They are skilled trackers and scouts, and know how to live off the land for months at a time.
Woodsmen add +2 to Survival and Stealth rolls made in the wild (not towns, ruins, or underground).
