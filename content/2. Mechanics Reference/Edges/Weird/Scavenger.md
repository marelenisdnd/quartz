# SCAVENGER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Luck
Once per encounter the hero may find, “suddenly remember,” or dig up some muchneeded piece of equipment, a quiver half-full of arrows, or some other useful device. The Game Master decides what constitutes an encounter, and has the final word on what can and can’t be found.
