# DANGER SENSE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice
Your hero can sense when something bad is about to happen. When rolling for Surprise (page 139), he adds +2 to his Notice roll to act in the first round. With a raise, he starts the encounter on Hold.
In other situations not covered by the Surprise rules (a sniper shot, pit trap, poisoned drink, etc.), Danger Sense gives him a Notice roll at −2 (or +2 if a Notice roll is usually allowed) to detect the hazard and take appropriate action. If this was an attack and the hero makes his Notice roll, the foe doesn’t get The Drop against him.
