WITCH
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d6+, Occult d4+
Some gain power through study, some through devotion, others through blood, but some gain power from communion with the unknown. Generally feared and misunderstood, the witch draws her magic from a pact made with an otherworldly power.
Communing with that source and using her familiar as a conduit, the witch gains not only a host of spells, but a number of strange abilities known as hexes. As the spellcaster grows in power, she might learn about the source of her magic, but many remain blissfully unaware of their patrons' true identity.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Witch):** Witches use Spellcasting as their arcane skill. They start with 10 Power Points and two powers chosen from the list below.
 - **AVAILABLE POWERS:** Baleful polymorph, beast friend, blind, burst, boost/lower Trait, conjure item, curse, damage field, detect/conceal arcana, dispel, empathy, fear, fly, healing, light/ darkness, locate, magic jar, mind reading, plane shift, protection, puppet, relief, resurrection, scrying, slumber, speak language, stun, summon ally, teleport.
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Any):** Witches require rapid, intricate, and unhindered somatic movements. While wearing light, medium, or heavy armor or using light, medium, or heavy shields, the character's Spellcasting rolls suffer a −4 penalty. The hero cannot use other abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.
 - **FAMILIAR:** Witches gain the service of a familiar that serve them and reveals secrets unknown to most mortals. The familiar uses the same rules as the Wizard Edge (see Pathfinder for Savage Worlds) with the following exceptions.
A witch’s familiar stores its mistress' spells (but not those learned from other Arcane Backgrounds), though it can't cast them itself. The witch must commune with her familiar every morning or lose access to her spells until she does so.
A witch may only have one familiar at a time, no matter how many Edges grant her one.
 - **HEX:** Witches have access to additional supernatural abilities called hexes. They gain one hex of her choice from the list on page 62 on taking this Class Edge. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.
