# RANGER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Athletics, Fighting, or Shooting d6+, Survival d6+
For those who relish the thrill of the hunt, there are only predators and prey. From scouts, to trackers, or bounty hunters, all rangers share the predator’s perspective. They value skill with weapons. They excel at stalking even the most elusive game. They train relentlessly to defeat a wide range of quarries.
Knowledgeable, patient, and skilled hunters, rangers pursue man, beast, and monster alike. While some track dangerous creatures to protect the frontier, others pursue more cunning game—even fugitives—into and through the dangerous wilds.
 - **ARMOR RESTRICTION (Medium):** Rangers are agile and mobile fighters and scouts. They subtract 4 from Agility and Agility based skill rolls when wearing heavy armor or using a heavy shield.
 - **FAVORED ENEMY:** Rangers study their foes, learning their ways, how to find them, and how to defeat them. Choose a type of enemy from the list on page 244. The ranger gets one free reroll when failing to track (Survival) or attack (Athletics (throwing), Fighting, Shooting) that type of being.
 - **FAVORED TERRAIN:** Choose a terrain type (Arctic, Desert, Forest, Jungle, Plains, Hills/ Mountains, Rivers/Seas, Swamp, Urban, or Underground). The ranger draws an additional Action Card for initiative when in his Favored Terrain. (This has no effect on the number of cards a Ranger can use, so a Level Headed character can still choose which card to use, while a Hesitant character must still take the worst card.)
 - **WILDERNESS STRIDE:** Rangers pass through rough terrain such as dense forest, rocky hills, or desert sands with ease. They ignore movement penalties for Difficult Ground (see page 124).

# QUARRY
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Ranger
The ranger's expertise expands to include additional enemies and terrain. Choose an additional enemy and terrain type for your Favored Enemy and Favored Terrain abilities.
This Edge may be taken once per Rank.

# HUNTER'S BOND (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Ranger
The ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. Once per encounter as a limited free action, the hunter grants his Favored Enemy benefit against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 5" (10 yards) who can see or hear him.
This lasts for five rounds, and does not stack with any Favored Enemy bonuses possessed by his allies.

# MYSTIC POWERS (RANGER)
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Ranger
As a limited free action the ranger can cast one of the following spells: beast friend, boost Trait (Athletics, Fighting, and Shooting only), entangle, and warrior’s gift. Boost Trait and warrior’s gift are self only, but the ranger gains no benefit from the Limitation (see page 168).
The woodsman has 10 dedicated Power Points that recharge normally (see page 169). He automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost, or with a raise for an additional 2 Power Points. He may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired (at the usual cost). See Chapter 5 for more information on specific spells. 
Mystic Powers doesn’t grant access to Edges requiring an Arcane Background. If the ranger also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges and abilities can be used with Mystic Powers (and vice-versa).

# MASTER HUNTER
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Ranger
Rangers have now become deadly enemies of their chosen prey. They add an additional d6 damage when making a successful Athletics (throwing), Fighting, or Shooting attack against their Favored Enemy.

# SEEN IT BEFORE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Ranger Edges
The ranger adds +4 to Evade, resist, or recover from any of his Favored Enemy's powers or abilities. The power must be able to be resisted or recovered from (such as blind or entangle).
It doesn't affect secondary effects, such as being Shaken by a creature's attack.
