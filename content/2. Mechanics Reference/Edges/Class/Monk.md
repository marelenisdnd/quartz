# MONK
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d6+, Spirit d6+, Fighting d6+
For the truly exemplary, martial prowess transcends the battlefield—it is a lifestyle, a doctrine, a state of mind. Such warriorartists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves as lethal as any blade. These monks adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines. They elevate their bodies to become weapons of war. Monks tread a path of discipline and balance— in mind, breath, and body.
 - **ARMOR RESTRICTION (Any):** Monks must be completely unhindered to perform their complex maneuvers. They subtract 4 from Agility and Agility-based skill rolls if using light, medium, or heavy armor or shields.
 - **MARTIAL DISCIPLINE:** Monks hone their bodies to perfection, gaining an additional +1 Toughness if wearing no armor.
 - **MOBILITY:** Quick and nimble, monks increase their running die by one die type.
 - **STUNNING FIST:** When a monk hits a target with an Unarmed Strike and scores a raise, he may make the foe Distracted or Vulnerable. This occurs even if the victim takes no damage or Soaks it (the states are applied after the victim attempts to Soak).
 - **UNARMED STRIKE:** Monks gain +1 to Fighting attacks when attacking unarmed and AP +2. They cause Str+d4 damage with their hands, feet, or other Natural Weapons (if they have such appendages, see page 136).
If the monk already has a Strength damage die from Claws (available to some ancestries), or the Brawler Edge, increase the damage a die type for each.
Monks can apply the Trademark Weapon Edge to their unarmed attacks.
Monks always count as armed. Some use regular weapons in their off-hand, but abilities that refer to their Unarmed Strike apply only to unarmed attacks as defined above.
On a raise the monk rolls a d10 for his bonus damage.

# MYSTIC POWERS (MONK) 
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Monk
As a limited free action, the monk can invoke one of the following "ki" powers: boost Trait (Agility, Athletics, Fighting, and Stealth only), deflection, smite, and speed. All are self only, but the monk gains no benefit from the Limitation (see page 168).
The monk has 10 dedicated Power Points that recharge normally (see page 169). He automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost, or with a raise for an additional 2 Power Points. He may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired (at the usual cost). See Chapter 5 for more information on specific spells.
Mystic Powers doesn’t grant access to Edges that require an Arcane Background. If the monk also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges or abilities can be used with Mystic Powers (and vice-versa).

# COCKATRICE STRIKE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Monk, Spirit d8+, Fighting d8+
With a single strike, the solemn warrior transmutes flesh to stone.
As a limited action, the monk can make a single unarmed strike against a Vulnerable, Stunned, Bound, or Incapacitated foe. If the target is Shaken or Wounded, he is petrified immediately (see curse in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds) unless he makes a Vigor roll (at −2 with a raise). The monk can end this effect at will. It automatically ends if the monk is Incapacitated.

# GREAT KI
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Monk, Mystic Powers (Monk)
The monk further nurtures and refines his ki. He adds the following spells to his Mystic Powers Edge: Boost Trait (Strength), protection, wall walker, warrior's gift.

# QUIVERING PALM (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Monk, Fighting d10+
The monk can send deadly vibrations through the body of a creature that can turn fatal if the monk so desires. Once per day, the monk can use Quivering Palm after hitting a target with an unarmed attack. Oozes, constructs, undead, and creatures without biological organs cannot be affected by Quivering Palm.
Anyone struck by the blow may be slain by the monk up to one week later. The monk need not see his target, he merely wills his demise (a free action). Unless the victim makes a Vigor roll (apply any penalties from a Called Shot on the attack to the Vigor roll), he immediately begins Bleeding Out.

# WHOLENESS OF BODY
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Monk, Mystic Powers (Monk)
The monk may spend 2 Power Points to make a Soak roll. This does not count as spending a Benny.

# PERFECT BODY (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Monk Edges
The monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an Outsider rather than a Humanoid (or whatever the monk’s creature type was), can speak all languages, and gains +4 Toughness against nonmagical attacks.
