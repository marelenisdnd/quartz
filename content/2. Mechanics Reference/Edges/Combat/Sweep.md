SWEEP
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d8+, Fighting d8+
Some heroes are able to face down multiple enemies at once.
As a limited action, Sweep allows a character to make a single Fighting attack with a two-handed weapon and apply it against all targets in his Reach at a −2 penalty (friends and foes alike). Resolve damage separately for each enemy that’s hit.
Note: Some creatures have the Sweep Edge even though they don't have twohanded weapons.
In their case their size, lanky limbs, or other advantages allow them to make Sweep attacks.

# IMPROVED SWEEP
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Sweep
As above but the whirlwind of death may ignore the −2 penalty.
