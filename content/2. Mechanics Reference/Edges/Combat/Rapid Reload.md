# RAPID RELOAD
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Shooting d6+
The warrior reduces the Reload value of a ranged weapon by 1. See Reload on page 137. This is most often taken for archers using crossbows with a Reload of 1 or 2. Weapons with Reload 1 may be reloaded as a free action with this Edge.
A character with this Edge may use Rapid Shot with a weapon if its Reload value has been reduced to a free action.
