SURVIVAL (SMARTS)
Survival allows a character to find food, water, or shelter in hostile environments. It can also be used to navigate wilderness environments, figure out which plants are good to eat and which aren’t, and so on.
A successful Survival roll provides enough food and water for one person for one day; or five people with a raise.
More detailed information on Hunger and Thirst can be found under Hazards on page 155.
**Tracking:** Survival can also be used to detect and follow tracks. Each roll generally covers following the tracks for one mile, but the GM should adjust this as needed for specific circumstances. A character moves at half Pace and cannot run while tracking a foe.
The Game Master should assign a bonus or penalty based on the target, environment, and time. Tracking a large group that recently passed through a snow-covered area might grant a bonus of +4, while following a single person over rocks and streams after more than a day incurs a −4 penalty.
