OCCULT (SMARTS)
Occult reflects knowledge and experience of magical and supernatural events, processes, items, and creatures.
It can be used to decipher glyphs, recall information about Golarion's monsters, recall cures for supernatural maladies like lycanthropy or vampirism, and so on. Finding information in a library, a wizard’s lair, or in an old dusty tome uses the Academics skill. If the investigator’s Occult skill is higher, she may use that instead. See Academics on page 33.
Some esoteric information will be familiar to people with certain skills. If the situation warrants (and with the GM's permission), you may substitute Faith or Spellcasting in place of Occult.
