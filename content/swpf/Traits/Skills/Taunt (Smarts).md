TAUNT (SMARTS)
Taunt attacks a person’s pride through ridicule, cruel jests, or oneupmanship. Taunt is an opposed roll resisted by the opponent’s Smarts. In combat, this is a Test (see page 140).
Out of combat, success means the defender backs down, slinks away, or starts a fight. A raise might leave the victim cowed for the remainder of the encounter, cause them to storm out in tears, or even make a reckless attack.
A Critical Failure on the Taunt means the target is immune to this character’s Taunts for the remainder of the encounter.
