INTIMIDATION (SPIRIT)
Intimidation is the art of frightening an opponent so that he backs down, reveals information, or flees.
Intimidation is an opposed roll resisted by the opponent’s Spirit. In combat, this is a Test (see page 140). Out of combat, a successful roll means the foe backs down for the most part, reveals some information, or slinks away when the opportunity presents itself. A raise might mean the target backs down for the remainder of the scene, spills all the beans, or runs away as fast as possible.
In or out of combat, a Critical Failure on the roll means the target is immune to this character’s Intimidation attempts for the remainder of this encounter!
**Networking:** Intimidation can also be used as a “macro” skill to simulate several hours of working the streets. See Networking on page 160 to see how to crack some heads for favors or information.
