REPAIR (SMARTS)
Repair is the ability to take apart and/or fix mechanical gadgets, vehicles, weapons, and other simple devices. It also covers the use of demolitions and explosives.
How long a Repair roll takes is up to the GM and the complexity of the task. Success means the item is functional. A raise on the Repair roll halves the time required.
**Tools:** Characters suffer a minor penalty (−1 to −2) to their roll if they don’t have access to basic tools, or a major penalty (−3 to −4) if the device requires specialized equipment.
