HEALING (SMARTS)
Healing has multiple uses, from treating Wounds to diagnosing diseases and analyzing certain kinds of forensic evidence. 
See page 128 for rules on mending and treating Wounds, and pages 152 and 155 for treatment of disease or poison. 
Healing can also be used to analyze evidence that relates to anatomical trauma, including cause of death and approximate time, a general angle of attack, and similar matters. Success provides basic information and a raise increases the details uncovered.
