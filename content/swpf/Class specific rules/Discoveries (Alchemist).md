# DISCOVERIES
Every alchemist searches for new scientific principles they can use to further their own knowledge. A character may choose one of these truths each time he takes the Discovery Edge.
 - **EXTEND POTION:** The alchemist can double the Duration of any potion, extract, or his own mutagen effect with a Duration greater than Instant.
 - **FAST BOMBS:** The alchemist can spend +1 Power Point to create and throw a bomb as an action instead of a limited action.
 - **DILUTION:** Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir (not extract or mutagen), creating two doses from one. Diluting a potion costs gp equal to one-quarter of the potion’s market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again.
 - **FERAL MUTAGEN:** Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he grows claws and fangs, gaining the Claw and Bite Natural Weapons (Str+d6), and a +2 bonus on Intimidation rolls.

# ADVANCED DISCOVERY
True alchemists yearn for the greater
advancements in knowledge, to better the
world or lord their genius over their peers!
 - **COMBINE EXTRACTS:** Once per day when the alchemist creates his extracts, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This lets the alchemist cast both powers with the same action and Alchemy roll.
 - **ETERNAL YOUTH:** The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward suffers no penalties due to his age. This removes any penalties caused by the Elderly Hindrance.
 - **INSTANT ALCHEMY:** The crafter can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed. He may create any of the alchemical items listed on page 89 or those in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds with an Alchemy roll and a limited action.
 - **DELAYED BOMB:** The alchemist can set a bomb so that it explodes up to ten rounds after he creates it. The creator may also reclaim the bomb, recovering its Power Points and preventing its detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if anyone else touches or moves it without a successful Thievery check.
An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at once. If he creates another, the previous bomb becomes inert. Dispel can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Thievery check (at −2 if it was created with a raise).

# GRAND DISCOVERY
The ultimate feat for any brew master is making a Grand Discovery the world will talk about for generations to come!
 - **FAST HEALING:** The alchemist’s flesh responds to damage with shocking speed— he gains the Fast Regeneration ability.
 - **ELIXIR OF LIFE:** Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes one hour of work. When administered by the alchemist who brewed it, it restores life to a dead creature as per resurrection, using the character's Alchemy roll. Alternatively, the alchemist may drink the elixir of life himself, rising as if resurrected if slain within five days of consumption!
 - **PHILOSOPHER’S STONE:** The alchemist learns how to create a philosopher’s stone, and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a philosopher’s stone takes one day of work (see its description of the Philosopher's Stone to the right of this entry).
 - **ETERNAL POTION:** If an alchemist drinks a potion with a non-instant Duration, he can choose to make the effect permanent or until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent. The effects of the potion can still be stopped with dispel.

### PHILOSOPHER’S STONE
This rare substance appears to be an ordinary piece of sooty, blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (Hardness 14) however, a cavity is revealed at the stone’s heart. The cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables anyone with at least a d6 in Academics to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher’s stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). The quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.
The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any healing potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as resurrection for any dead body it’s sprinkled on.

Weight: 3 lbs.
Destruction: The philosopher’s stone can be destroyed by being placed in the heel of a titan’s boot for at least 1 entire week.
