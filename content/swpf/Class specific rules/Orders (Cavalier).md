# CAVALIER ORDERS
The following orders are the most common throughout Golarion. Members are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order. Names of these orders might vary depending on the region. A cavalier gains his order's Order Ability upon taking the appropriate Edge.

### ORDER OF THE COCKATRICE
A cavalier who belongs to this order serves only himself, working to further his own aims and increase his personal prestige.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must keep his own interests and aims above those of all others. He must always accept payment when it is due, rewards when earned, and an even (or greater) share of loot when possible. The cavalier must take every opportunity to increase his own stature, prestige, and power.
 - **CHALLENGE:** The cavalier adds +2 damage to Fighting attacks made against the target of his challenge.
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Steal Glory):** Once per round, when an ally targets a foe within the cavalier's Reach, the cavalier may make a free attack against the same target.

### ORDER OF THE DRAGON
Cavaliers belonging to the order of the dragon dedicate themselves to a group of like-minded individuals, be it a mercenary company or a small band of adventurers. They believe in loyalty and friendship, and are willing to lay down their lives to protect their allies.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must remain loyal to his allies and always work to further the aims of the group. He must protect his allies from harm and defend their honor when called into doubt.
 - **CHALLENGE:** As a limited action, the cavalier grants his allies a +2 bonus on Fighting rolls against the target of his challenge until the end of the round.
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Aid Allies):** Whenever an order of the dragon cavalier Supports an ally, the ally also receives the Support bonus to their Parry for the rest of the round.

### ORDER OF THE LION
A cavalier who belongs to this order has pledged himself to a sovereign; be it a king, queen, or even the local warlord. They are stalwart and dedicated to their cause, willing to go to any length to ensure the safety of their lord and his domain.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must protect the life and lands of his sovereign at all costs. He must obey his lord's commands without question and strive to expand the power and prestige of his realm.
 - **CHALLENGE:** The target of the cavalier's challenge is Distracted as long as the cavalier is within 10" (20 yards).
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Shield of the Liege):** A selfless lion cavalier may redirect a melee or ranged attack made against an adjacent ally to himself. This ability can be used any number of times per day but must be declared before the attack roll is made.

### ORDER OF THE SHIELD
Cavaliers who join the order of the shield devote their lives to protecting the common folk, from the simple farmer to the honest craftsman. These cavaliers stand before the tide, protecting the innocent from roving marauders and hungry monsters.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must protect the lives and prosperity of the common folk, shielding them from the deprivations of any who would cause them harm or exploit them. He must give charity when it is warranted and aid where needed. He must take no action that would cause harm or hardship to those who cannot defend themselves.
 - **CHALLENGE:** Whenever an order of the shield cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +2 bonus on opposed Tests with the target of his challenge.
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Stem the Tide):** Once per round when an enemy enters Reach of one of his weapons the cavalier may make a free and cannot move any further this round.

### ORDER OF THE STAR
Cavaliers who join the order of the star dedicate themselves to the protection and service of a faith and its members (chosen when this Edge is selected). Thereafter they tend to following many of the tenets and guides of the religion they serve.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must strive to protect the faith and all those who follow its teachings, from priest to common person. He must adhere to the strictures of the faith, promote its cause whenever possible, and serve the agents of the divine.
 - **CHALLENGE:** The target of the cavalier's challenge subtracts 2 from his arcane skill rolls.
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Calling):** Once per encounter as a limited free action, the cavalier may choose one of his Traits and make a short prayer, filling him with confidence.
For the next five rounds, all rolls using that Trait gain a +2 bonus.

### ORDER OF THE SWORD
Cavaliers who join the order of the sword dedicate their lives to the code of chivalry, living a life of honor, valor, and fairness. They tend to swear service to a lord or a lady, or sometimes to a creature of renown.
Of all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.
 - **EDICTS:** The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.
 - **CHALLENGE:** The cavalier gets a free reroll on failed Fighting rolls against the target of his challenge.
 - **ORDER ABILITY (Mounted Mastery):** Cavaliers eventually learn to turn the long reach of pole-arms and other weapons designed to defeat horsemen against their wielders. Whenever a mounted cavalier makes a charge attack, he adds his mountâ€™s Strength roll to the damage (rather than the usual +4 charge bonus for mounted attacks, see Mounted Combat in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds).
