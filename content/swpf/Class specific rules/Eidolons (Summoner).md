# EIDOLONS
When the mage first conjures his eidolon, he picks a base form (biped, quadruped, or serpentine), and gains 3 Evolution Points to buy Evolutions. It may gain additional Evolution Points via the Extra Evolution Edge (see page 52). The eidolon can redistribute its points whenever it gains more or when its master reaches a new Rank.
The details of the creature's form are up to the summoner, but its base form is permanent and unmistakably that of a unique and fantastic creature. An eidolon can speak all its summoner's languages, and cannot make natural healing rolls (it must be healed).
The eidolon bears a glowing rune identical to one that appears on the summonerâ€™s forehead when the creature is summoned. The rune can be hidden through mundane means, but can't be concealed by magic such as disguise (although invisibility conceals it along with the summoner as usual).
The eidolon gains an Advancement at creation and for each of its maker's Ranks after Novice (and every four Advances after Legendary) and its Rank is the same as its master's. The summoner can spend Conviction to rearrange the eidolon's Evolution Points.
