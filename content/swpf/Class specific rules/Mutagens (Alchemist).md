MUTAGENS
Mutagens alter the alchemist's form, increasing his physique for one hour at the cost of mental impairment.
Brewing a mutagen costs an hour's work and two Power Points but no arcane skill roll. The Power Points are stored and don't replenish until the mutagen is consumed or destroyed. An alchemist may only have one active mutagen in existence at a time.
Choose one of the three options below when the mutagen is created. Drinking it (an action) has the listed effect and also hardens the imbiber's skin, increasing Toughness by +1.
 - **STRENGTH:** +2 to Strength and melee damage rolls but −2 on Academics, Common Knowledge, Occult, Repair, Science, and arcane skill rolls.
 - **AGILITY:** Opponents subtract 1 when making direct attacks against the alchemist. The alchemist subtracts 2 from Healing, Notice, Survival, and Taunt rolls.
 - **VIGOR:** +2 to Vigor rolls but −2 to Battle, Gambling, Performance, and Persuasion rolls.
