Requires claws or pincers. • Rending: Victims Shaken or Wounded by a rending attack are bleeding and must make a Vigor roll as a free action at the beginning of their next turn.

A raise (or a successful Healing roll) stops the bleeding. |

If the eidolon is Shaken or Wounded from the inside (ignoring its Armor!), everyone inside gets an immediate Athletics roll to escape.
