# CAVALIER MOUNT
The cavalier's dedication to mastering mounted combat grants additional benefits to his companion. In addition to being more formidable than other animals of its kind, the mount also forms a special bond with its rider, allowing them to anticipate each other's needs.
Whenever the cavalier purchases or acquires a mount, he can spend some time working with his new friend to grant it a number of benefits based on his Rank (see Advancement below). If the cavalier's mount ever dies or is lost, the knight must spend time working with a new mount in order to regain these benefits.
**Advancement:** The cavalier's mount gains the following abilities based on its master's Rank. These benefits are cumulative.
 - **NOVICE:** Hardy.
 - **SEASONED:** Resilient.
 - **VETERAN:** Very Resilient.
 - **HEROIC:** The mount becomes a Wild Card.
**Bond:** Whenever the cavalier's mount suffers one or more Wounds, the cavalier can spend a Benny to make a Soak roll using his Riding skill.
