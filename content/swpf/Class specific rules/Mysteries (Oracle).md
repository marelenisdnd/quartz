# MYSTERIES
Each Mystery lists the deity most closely associated with it, the available powers it grants, and the Greater Revelation the oracle gains if she takes that Edge.

### BATTLE
Deity: Cayden Cailean, Gorum, Iomedae, Rovagug.
Available Powers: Barrier, deflection, growth/ shrink, stun.
Greater Revelation (Battlecry): Once per encounter as a limited action, the character may unleash an inspiring battlecry. All allies within 12" (24 yards) who can hear the cry add +1 to their Trait rolls for the next five rounds.

### BONES
Deity: Norgorber, Pharasma, Urgathoa.
Available Powers: Bolt, damage field, fear, zombie.
Greater Revelation (Soul Siphon): As a limited action, the character can make a Faith roll against a target within Range Smarts. If successful, the target suffers Energy Drain (Spirit or Vigor) (see Energy Drain in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds).

### FLAME
Deity: Asmodeus, Sarenrae.
Available Powers: Burst, darksight, environmental protection, smite.
Greater Revelation (Form of Flame): Once per encounter as a limited action, the oracle can assume one of the following three forms.
 - **ELEMENTAL:** The oracle becomes a fire elemental (see the Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Bestiary) for 10 rounds (she remains a Wild Card).
 - **MOLTEN SKIN:** The oracle gains Immunity to Fire and projects a major damage field (fiery aura) for five rounds.
 - **WINGS OF FIRE:** The character manifests a pair of fiery wings for ten minutes. This grants her Flight (Pace 12).

### HEAVENS
Deity: Desna, Gozreh, Pharasma, Sarenrae.
Available Powers: Banish, confusion, divination, fly.
Greater Revelation (Mantle of Moonlight): The character's innate understanding of the moon renders her immune to lycanthropy.
She may also disrupt a lycanthrope’s connection to the moon with a successful Touch Attack, forcing it into its humanoid form, where it must remain for five rounds.
Once per encounter, the hero can make a successful Touch Attack to force someone into or out of a Rage (see Barbarian in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds) even if they could not normally rage.

### LIFE
Deity: Gozreh, Pharasma, Sarenrae.
Available Powers: Healing, light/darkness, relief, sanctuary.
Greater Revelation (Energy Body): Once per encounter as a limited action, the hero can transform her body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental for five rounds.
She becomes the Special Ability: Elemental and gives off a warm light that increases illumination within a Medium Blast Template by one step, up to normal light. Undead starting their turn in the template suffer 2d4 damage. The oracle reduces the cost of healing by 1 when targeting someone in this template.

### LORE
Deity: Abadar, Irori, Nethys.
Available Powers: Detect/conceal arcana, speak language, locate, time stop.
Greater Revelation (Spontaneous Symbology): The oracle's knowledge of the secret history of the world has revealed untold truths. The oracle may spend a Benny to cast any power of her Rank or lower. The power may be maintained normally but afterwards is forgotten (the oracle doesn’t add it to her list of powers).

### NATURE
Deity: Erastil, Gozreh.
Available Powers: Beast friend, elemental manipulation, shape change, summon nature's ally.
Greater Revelation (Spirit of Nature): The seer gains Fast Regeneration until she's Incapacitated.

### STONE
Deity: Abadar, Gorum, Torag.
Available Powers: Barrier, burrow, create pit, protection.
Greater Revelation (Steelbreaker Skin): Once per encounter as a limited action, the character may harden her flesh for five rounds so weapons that strike her are damaged or destroyed.
Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes the oracle, it takes 1d6 damage plus an additional 1d6 for every Power Point she spends (up to a max of 3). If this shatters the weapon, the oracle takes no damage from that attack. This has no effect on Natural Weapons.

### WAVES
Deity: Gozreh, Pharasma.
Available Powers: Barrier, environmental protection, havoc, intangibility.
Greater Revelation (Storm): Once per day, as an action, the oracle may create a raging storm that stretches out for half a mile in all directions. The storm occurs only outside, limits visibility to 24" (48 yards), and decreases Illumination one level. The tempest lasts five rounds and may be extended another five rounds by spending a Power Point.
As a limited free action, the oracle may focus part of the tempest into a hailstorm that causes 2d6 damage in a Large Blast Template anywhere within 24" (48 yards).

### WIND
Deity: Gozreh, Shelyn.
Available Powers: Deflection, fly, havoc, elemental manipulation.
Greater Revelation (Lightning Breath): As a limited action, the oracle can breathe lightning. This functions as minor burst. The oracle can spend 2 Power Points to make it major burst. This ability uses the Stream Template.
