# HEXES
 - **AGONY:** As a limited action, the witch makes an opposed Spirit roll against an enemy within a Range equal to her Smarts. With success, she makes the target Distracted or Vulnerable (both with a raise).
 - **AUGMENT:** The witch may cast the following powers as a limited free action: curse, fly (the hex doesn't grant these powers).
 - **BLIGHT:** The witch curses an animal, plant, or a plot of land. This takes a full round of concentration, and she and her familiar must be in contact with part of the area to be corrupted. If used on a plot of land, plants wither the following day and die completely over the next week. Nothing grows in that area so long as the hex persists.
A witch may affect an area with a radius equal to twice her Smarts. Dispel can be used to remove a blight, but the caster must first walk the perimeter of the blighted area for one hour before attempting to cast. The witch can instead take an action to blight a creature of the Animal or Plant Type. The witch touches the target and makes a Spellcasting roll. Success reduces the creature's Toughness by 4 (to a minimum of 1). At the end of each of the creature's turns it makes a Spirit roll (at −2 with a raise) as a free action to end the effect. A witch can only have one blight in effect at a time. Casting a new one terminates the other immediately.
 - **CACKLE:** A witch may issue a hideous and disturbing cackle as a free action. Distracted or Vulnerable creatures don't remove these conditions as long as they remain within 10" (20 yards) of a cackling witch.
 - **CHARM:** The witch may cast the following powers as a limited free action: beast friend, puppet (this hex doesn't grant these powers).
 - **EVIL EYE:** The witch may cast the following powers as a limited free action: boost/lower Trait, slumber (the hex does not grant her these powers).
 - **HEALING:** The witch may cast the following powers as a limited free action: healing, relief (the hex does not grant her these powers).

# MAJOR HEXES
 - HAG’S EYE: The witch creates an invisible magical sensor that sends her visual information. She creates the eye within a Range of Smarts. The eye the size of a normal human eyeball and has Flight at Pace 6. It sees exactly as the witch would if she were there.
The eye can’t leave the witch's plane for any reason. It functions for one minute increments, up to 10 minutes per day.
 - **NIGHTMARES:** The witch may automatically place a curse on a target within a Range of twice her Smarts. The victim must make a Spirit roll at −2 when it tries to sleep or be tormented by terrible nightmares, preventing her from resting (see Sleep Hazards in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). If the Spirit roll is successful the nightmares pass until the witch hexes him again.
 - **VISION:** The witch can grant a glimpse of the future to a creature she touches. Granting a vision takes a full minute of concentration, during which time she must remain in contact with her subject. At the end of this time, the target receives a brief image of the near future (usually no more than one year) of the Game Master's discretion. The witch can grant this individual no further visions until this one has come to pass (or not). This is only the most likely version of the future, so such visions are unreliable at best. A witch cannot use this ability on herself.
 - **WAXEN IMAGE:** This hex gives the witch the puppet power if she doesn't already have it. As a limited action, she may create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within a Range of Smarts. She may then cast puppet on the target of her waxen image from any distance. If she can see the target she adds +2 to the roll. The waxen image melts after use, so she must make a new one after each casting.
The witch can only have one waxen image at a time. If she creates another, the previous image becomes useless.
 - **WEATHER CONTROL:** The witch may cast elemental manipulation with the Weather Power Modifier at no cost, once per day.

# GRAND HEXES
 - **DEATH CURSE:** As an action, this hex seizes a creature’s heart, causing death in just a few moments. Death Curse has a Range of 5" (10 yards), and the target makes a Spirit roll. If failed, the creature takes Fatigue each round until it's Incapacitated, then makes a Vigor check or dies. With success, he takes 3d6 damage (ignoring Armor) and the hex ends. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, though the Fatigue remains. A creature cannot be the target of Death Curse again for an entire day.
 - **ETERNAL SLUMBER:** As a limited action, the witch makes a Touch Attack with Spellcasting. With success, the target makes a Spirit roll (−2 with a raise). Failing this check causes it to fall into a deep slumber from which it cannot be woken except by a wish or by slaying the witch who cast it! A witch can also poison food or drink with her hex, causing the next person to consume it to be affected. She may only have one such poisoned dish at a time, and it loses its potency after one minute if not consumed. A creature can't be affected by Eternal Slumber more than once per day.
 - **FORCED REINCARNATION:** The witch can move and take free actions, but can take no other actions other than performing this hex. The witch makes a Spellcasting roll, targeting her victim within a Range equal to her Smarts. With success, the target must make a Spirit check (at −2 with a raise on the Spellcasting roll), or die and be immediately reincarnated into a new body (roll on the chart below to see what the creature is). The reincarnated form is still a Wild Card if it was one before the hex was cast. A creature cannot be the target of this hex more than once a day.
