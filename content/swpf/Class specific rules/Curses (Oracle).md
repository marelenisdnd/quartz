Innate Powers: Major detect arcana (self only).

### HAUNTED
Malevolent spirits follow the oracle around, causing mishaps and strange occurrences. Retrieving stored items from her gear is an action, unless it normally takes longer. Items she drops land d6" away in a random direction.
Innate Powers: Minor fly (Self, levitate up or down only).

### LAME

Innate Powers: Minor speak language (self only, while not under the effects of Tongues).
