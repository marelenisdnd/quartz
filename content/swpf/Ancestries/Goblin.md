# GOBLINS 
It’s been almost 20 years since the end of the Goblinblood Wars that scorched the Chitterwood, forcing dozens of tribes into hiding. Now with new threats rising up, the many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that give them a chance at survival. While many have stayed to protect their homelands, others have become refugees, with some traveling to Absalom in search of a home that might offer them sanctuary in a world that does not trust them. 

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 
Goblins are short, ugly humanoids. Their scrawny bodies are topped with oversized and usually hairless heads with massive ears and beady red or occasionally yellow eyes. Goblins’ skin tone varies based on the surrounding environment; common skin tones include green, gray, and blue, though black and even pale white goblins have been sighted. Their voracious appetites are served well by their huge mouths filled with jagged teeth. 

### SOCIETY 
Even those goblins who break from their destructive past often subtly perpetuate some of the qualities that have been tied to the creatures for millennia. Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them from physical harm or offered a sympathetic ear when they learn of the goblins’ woes. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire, or fearlessly devour meals that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash simply as components of gadgets yet to be made. Occasionally, fellow adventurers find these proclivities unsettling or odd, but more often than not, goblins’ friends consider these qualities endearing. Goblins reach adolescence by the age of three and adulthood four or five years later. In theory, goblins could live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age. Goblins typically stand about 3 feet tall, with skin colors that range from green to gray to blue. 

**Relations:** Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation across the Inner Sea region has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and as a result many goblins work twice as hard at proving their worth. Those who befriend a goblin quickly learn that while a goblin’s friendship might include all manners of pranks, such fun comes from a place of true acceptance— something that a goblin does not give freely. 

**Religion:** Many goblin adventurers typically worship Cayden Cailean. 

### ADVENTURERS 
Some backgrounds make for particularly good adventurers. Goblins who come from lawless tribes may seek refuge while entertainers may seek a living performing for audiences around the world. Many goblins consider alchemy, since they love fire or life as a bard, since many goblins love songs. Scrappy survivors often take to the role of a rogue who darts about the shadows, though their natural charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical power, such as that of a sorcerer or wizard. 

**Languages:** Common, Goblin. 

 - **AGILE:** Goblins are fast and agile. They start with a d8 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 2. 

 - **CAPABLE RIDER:** Goblins start with a d4 in Riding. 

 - **DARKVISION:** Goblin eyes are able to pierce the darkness. They ignore penalties for Illumination up to 10” (20 yards). 

 - **OUTSIDER (Major):** Almost every non-goblin culture is suspicious of goblins. They subtract 2 from all Persuasion rolls and are often bullied by others. 

 - **SIZE −1:** Averaging roughly three feet tall, goblins reduce their Size and Toughness by 1. 

 - **SNEAKY:** Goblins start with a d6 in Stealth instead of a d4. This increases maximum Stealth to d12 + 1. 

#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES 

 - **EAT ANYTHING:** Raised with little or no proper food, many goblins have learned to survive by eating whatever they happen across and can digest nearly anything without getting sick. Goblins with this ability get a free reroll on Survival checks to forage for food and a +2 bonus on Vigor checks caused by consuming toxic substances. This ancestral ability replaces Capable Rider. 

 - **HARD HEAD, BIG TEETH:** Goblins are known for their balloonlike heads and enormous maws, but some have even more exaggeratedly large heads filled with razor-sharp teeth. Goblins with this trait gain a bite (Str+d4). This ancestral ability replaces Sneaky. 

 - **OVER-SIZED EARS:** While goblins’ ears are never dainty, these goblins have freakishly large ears capable of picking up even the smallest sounds. Goblins with this ancestral ability start with a d6 in Notice instead of a d4. This increases maximum Notice to d12 + 1. This replaces Capable Rider.
