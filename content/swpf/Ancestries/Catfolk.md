# CATFOLK
![[Catfolk.png|right|200]] 
Catfolk are natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such efforts are not limited to the search for distant lands. Many catfolk see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. Catfolk are curious by nature, and their culture never discourages inquisitiveness, but rather fosters and encourages it. Outsiders see them as quirky extroverts, but within catfolk tribes there is no shame attached to minor peculiarities, eccentricities, or foolhardiness. All but the most inwardly focused catfolk enjoy being the center of attention, but not at the expense of their tribe, whether it’s the one the catfolk are born into or the tribe they choose through the bonds of friendship. Catfolk tend to be both generous and loyal to their family and friends. 

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 
Catfolk are lithe and slender, standing between dwarves and humans in stature. While clearly humanoid, they possess many feline features, including a coat of soft fine fur, slit pupils, catlike ears, and a sleek, slender tail. Their fingers terminate in small, sharp, retractable claws, though they are typically not powerful enough to be used as weapons. Some members of the species—either by quirk of birth or from years of honing—can use them with deadly effect. Feline whiskers are not uncommon, and hair and eye color vary greatly. 

### SOCIETY 
While self-expression is an important aspect of catfolk culture, it is mitigated by a strong sense of community and group effort. The pursuit of personal power never comes before the health and wellbeing of the tribe. More than one enemy has underestimated this seemingly gentle people only to discover much too late that their cohesion also provides them great strength. Catfolk prefer to be led by their most competent members, usually a council of sub-chieftains chosen through consensus or election. The sub-chiefs then choose a chieftain to lead in times of danger and to mediate disputes among the sub-chiefs. The chieftain is the most capable member of the tribe, and is often magically talented. Catfolk who settle in more urban and civilized areas still cling to a similar tribal structure, but often see friends outside the tribe, even noncatfolk, as part of their extended tribe. Within adventuring groups, catfolk who do not consider themselves the obvious choice as chieftain often defer to the person who most resembles their cultural ideal of a chieftain. 

**Relations:** Adaptable and curious, catfolk get along with almost any ancestry that extends reciprocal goodwill. They acclimate easily to halflings, humans, and especially elves. Catfolk and elves share a passionate nature, as well as a love of music, dance, and storytelling; elven communities often mentor catfolk tribes, though such elves are careful not to act in a patronizing manner toward their feline friends. Gnomes make natural companions for catfolk, as catfolk enjoy their strange and obsessive qualities. Catfolk are tolerant of kobolds as long as the reptilian beings respect the catfolk’s boundaries. The feral nature of orcs stirs as much puzzlement as it does revulsion among catfolk, as they don’t understand orcs’ savagery and propensity for self-destruction. Half-orcs, on the other hand, intrigue catfolk, especially those half-orcs who strive to excel beyond the deleterious and hateful nature of their savage kin. 

**Religion:** The gods Desna, Cayden Cailean, and Shelyn all speak to the souls of catfolk, and many tribes depict the latter two as catfolk themselves. The quest for self-improvement has led many an individual to explore different philosophies, including the worship of Irori. 

### ADVENTURERS 
Natural born trackers, the hunter-gatherer aspect of their tribes pushes many catfolk toward occupations as rangers and guides, but such roles don’t always speak to their love of performance art, be it song, dance, or storytelling. Catfolk legends also speak of a rich tradition of great sorcerers. Those catfolk who internalize their wanderlust often become wizards and monks. Catfolk understand that exploration and self-knowledge can lead down many roads, and are accepting of nearly all professions and ways of life. 

**Languages:** Common, Catfolk. 

 - **AGILE:** Catfolk are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. 

 - **CAT'S LUCK:** Catfolk get a free reroll on failed Evasion rolls. 

 - **LOW LIGHT VISION:** Like other feline creatures, catfolk can see perfectly in low light. They ignore penalties for Dim and Dark Illumination. 

 - **SPRINTER:** Catfolk increase their running die by one die type. 

#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES 
 - **CAT’S CLAWS:** Feral catfolk have stronger and more developed claws than other members of their species. Catfolk with this ability have a pair of claws that deal Str+d4 damage (see Natural Weapons in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). This replaces Agile. 

 - **NIMBLE FALLER:** Some catfolk have an amazing sense of balance and keen knowledge of their own center of gravity. Catfolk with this ability land on their feet even when they take damage from a fall. Furthermore, catfolk with this ability reduce falling damage by 1d6 + 1. This replaces Sprinter. 

 - **SCENT:** These catfolk favor a keen sense of smell over sensitive sight. Catfolk with this ability ignore up to 4 points of penalties when attacking foes hidden by magical darkness, invisibility or similar abilities. This replaces Low Light Vision.
