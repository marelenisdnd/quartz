# DHAMPIRS 
The half-living children of vampires and human females, dhampirs are progenies of tragedy. The circumstances of a dhampir’s conception are often called into question but scarcely understood, as few mothers survive the childbirth. Those who do often abandon their children and refuse to speak of the matter. While some speculate dhampirs result when mortals couple with vampires, others claim they form when a pregnant woman suffers a vampire bite. Some particularly zealous scholars even contest dhampirs’ status as a unique ancestry, instead viewing them as humans suffering from an unholy affliction. Indeed, this hypothesis is strengthened by dhampirs’ seeming inability to reproduce; their offspring are inevitably humans. Regardless, they live and die just like any other mortal creatures, despite possessing a supernatural longevity akin to that of elves. Hardship and suffering fill a dhampir’s formative years. Most grow up as orphans, and despite their exquisite features, they face a lifetime of prejudice, mistrust, fear, and persecution. Humans who witness the nature of a dhampir child’s supernatural powers or sensitivity to daylight display an array of reactions ranging from awe to terror to outright hatred. Eventually, a dhampir must learn to cope with these difficulties and find his place in the world. Dhampirs keep few, if any, close companions. Even with those they feel attached to, most dhampirs are sullen and reserved. Some fear the persecution heaped upon them may be transferred to their companions, whereas others worry their own bloodlust will one day overwhelm them and they’ll inadvertently turn upon their friends. 

### PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 
Tall and slender and with well-defined musculature, dhampirs look like statuesque humans of unearthly beauty. Their hair, eye, and skin colors resemble unnerving versions of their mothers’; many possess a ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the color of a bruise. While many dhampirs can pass as humans, their features are inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All dhampirs have elongated incisors. While not true fangs, these teeth are sharp enough to draw blood, and many suffer a desire to indulge in sanguinary delights, despite the fact that it provides no physical benefit. 

### SOCIETY 
Dhampirs have no culture of their own, nor do they have any known lands or even communities. Often born in secret and abandoned at orphanages or left to die, they tend to live solitary lives. Individuals acquire the cultural beliefs and teachings of the regions in which they grow up, and adopt additional philosophies over the course of their lives. This ability to adapt to a variety of circumstances provides dhampirs with a social camouflage that hides them from both predators and prey. 

**Relations:** As dhampirs are scions of evil, few outsiders view them favorably. They share an affinity for those half-breeds whose ancestry also sets them apart from human society, particularly tieflings and half-orcs. Humans view them with a combination of fear and pity, though such feelings often devolve into hatred and violence. Others, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, simply shun them. 

**Religion:** Dhampirs who become vampire hunters tend to worship Sarenrae or Pharasma, depending on their moral stance. Those who have spiraled into evil and embraced their undead heritage typically worship the demon lord Zura the Vampire Queen or Urgathoa, goddess of the undead. 

### ADVENTURERS 
The life of an adventurer comes naturally to most dhampirs, since constant persecution condemns many to spend their days wandering. Regardless of their reasons, most dhampirs simply feel more at home on the road than in a settlement. Almost universally, those inclined toward magic pursue the field of necromancy, though dhampir alchemists have been known to obsess over transforming their own bodies with potions and mutagens. 

**Languages:** Common. 

 - **AGILE:** Dhampirs are graceful and agile. They start with a d6 in Agility instead of a d4. This increases maximum Agility to d12 + 1. 

 - **DETECT UNDEAD:** As a limited action, a dhampir can sense undead within 20" (40 yards). As a limited free action, the dhampir knows the number of undead and can estimate how powerful each one is. 

 - **LIGHT SENSITIVE:** Dhamphirs suffer a −1 on Trait rolls requiring sight while in bright light. 

 - **NIGHT VISION:** Dhampirs ignore all penalties for Illumination. 

 - **REDUCED VITALITY:** Dhampirs suffer −1 Toughness. 

 - **UNDEAD RESISTANCE:** Damphirs get a free reroll to resist contracting diseases and are immune to Energy Drain (see Energy Drain in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). 

#### ALTERNATE ANCESTRAL ABILITIES 

 - **DAYBORN:** A few dhampirs are born during the day under the blessings of priests, and their blood has weaker ties to their undead bloodline than others. Such dhampirs are unhindered by daylight and lose Light Sensitivity and replace Night Vision with Low Light Vision. 

 - **FANGS:** On occasion, a dhampir may inherit his father’s lengthy canines. These dhampir can make bite attacks dealing Str+d4 damage (See Natural Weapons in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds). This replaces Undead Resistance. 

 - **VAMPIRIC EMPATHY:** Though dhampirs often relate poorly to humanoids, some share an affinity with baser creatures. These dhampirs gain the ability to communicate with bats, rats, and wolves. In addition, they get a free reroll on failed Persuasion rolls when dealing with these animals. This replaces Detect Undead.
