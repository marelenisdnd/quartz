| TYPE | RANGE | DAMAGE | AP | ROF | BLAST | WEIGHT | COST | CRAFTING MODIFIER |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | -- | --- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ----------------- |
| Acid flask | 3/6/12 | 2d4 | — | 1 | SBT | 1 | 10 |
| Notes: Thrown like a grenade. Those within the template take 2d4 damage when hit and 2d4–2 damage at the start of their next turn unless the acid is washed off somehow. |
| Alchemist’s Fire | 3/6/12 | 2d4 | — | 1 | SBT | 1 | 20 |
|Notes: A sticky, flammable liquid that ignites on impact. Heavy Weapon. Those within the template take 2d4 damage when hit and 2d4–2 damage at the start of their next turn unless dowsed with water. Target might catch Fire (see page 154). |
| Alchemist's Kindness | — | — | — | — | — | — | 10 | — |
| Notes: Favored by young rakes and others of means, this is a crystalline powder resembling salt. It makes a fizzing cocktail when mixed with water that eliminates the effects of a hangover within 10 minutes of consumption. |
| Alkali Flask | 3/6/12 | 2d4 | — | 1 | SBT | 1 | 15 | — |
| Notes: This flask of caustic liquid acts like acid against oozes and other acid-based creatures, but has no harmful effects on others. |
| Antitoxin, vial | — | — | — | — | — | 1/2 | 50 |
| Notes: Grants a +4 bonus to resist poison for one hour. |
| Bloodblock | — | — | — | — | — | — | 25 | −2 |
| Notes: This gooey, pinkish substance helps treat wounds. Using a dose ends the effects of Rending attack and Bleeding Out. |
| Everburning torch | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 110 |
| Notes: A "torch" permanently enchanted with light. It does not burn and emits no heat. |
| Flash Powder | 3/6/12 | — | — | 1 | SBT | — | 50 | — |
| Notes: This coarse gray powder ignites and burns almost instantly if exposed to flame, significant friction, or even a simple force such as throwing it against a floor. Creatures within a Small Blast Template are blinded (per the blind spell) until the end of their next turn. |
| Holy Water | 3/6/12 | 2d4 | — | 1 | SBT | — | 25 |
| Notes: Holy water can be thrown in a flask or splashed on an adjacent creature. Undead and certain evil creatures (GM's call) within the template take 2d4 damage when hit and 2d4–2 damage at the start of their next turn. |
| Liquid Ice | 3/6/12 | 2d4 | — | 1 | SBT | 2 | 40 | — |
| Notes: Also known as “alchemist’s ice,” this sealed jar of crystalline blue fluid immediately starts to evaporate once opened. During the next 1d6 rounds, an adventure can use it to freeze a liquid or coat an object in a thin layer of ice. It can also be thrown as a weapon. |
| Nushadir | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 10 | — |
| Notes: Stored in the form of small, salty pellets in a dry container, this reagent can be mixed with a flask of water and stored safely. Nushadir neutralizes acid; a vial of pellets or a flask of nushadir water is enough to render a cubic foot of acid safe to touch in one minute, though this is usually too slow to prevent damage from a thrown vial of acid or the contents of a large monster’s gullet. |
| Smelling Salts | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 25 | −2 |
| Notes: These sharply scented gray crystals cause people to regain consciousness when inhaled. Smelling salts grant a sleeping person a Spirit roll to wake up from both magical and mundane sleep. A container has 12 uses if stoppered after each use, but depletes in a matter of hours if left open. |
| Smokestick | 3/6/12 | — | — | 1 | MBT | 1/10 | 20 |
| Notes: An alchemically treated stick that creates thick smoke (Dark illumination) in a Medium Blast Template for one minute. Dissipates in strong wind in one round. |
| Smoke Pellet | 3/6/9 | — | — | 1 | — | — | 25 | — |
| Notes: This small clay sphere contains two alchemical substances separated by a thin barrier. When the sphere is broken, the substances mingle and fill a Small Blast Template with a cloud of foul but harmless yellow smoke. The smoke pellet acts as a smokestick, except the smoke only lasts for one round before dispersing. |
| Sunrod | — | 1d6 | — | — | — | 1 | 2 |
| Notes: A gold-tipped iron rod that provides normal light in a 30 foot radius for six hours. It increases illumination one level for another 30' beyond that. It emits no heat, and counts as sunlight. |
| Tanglefoot bag | 1/2/4 | — | — | 1 | — | 4 | 50 |
| Notes: A Size 3 or smaller victim hit by this small sack of sticky materials is Distracted for five rounds and must make an Athletics roll or be stuck to the ground (Entangled) as well. |
| Thunderstone | 3/6/12 | — | — | 1 | MBT | 1 | 30 |
| Notes: An enchanted rock that explodes with a deafening boom when struck against a hard surface. Anyone in the template must make a Vigor roll or be Shaken as well as deafened for one hour. |
| Tindertwig | — | — | — | — | — | 1/10 | 1 |
| Notes: A thin stick that alights with flame when struck against a hard surface. It allows torches and other flammable substances to be lit in a single action. |
| Weapon Blanch, Adamantine | — | — | — | — | — | 1/2 | 100 | −2 |
| Notes: When this powder is poured on a weapon and placed over a hot flame it melts and forms a temporary coating. On the next successful hit with the blanched weapon, it triggers Environmental Weaknesses (Adamantine). Each dose coats one weapon or up to 10 pieces of ammunition. Only one type of weapon blanch can be on a weapon at one time. |
| Weapon Blanch, Cold Iron | — | — | — | — | — | 1/2 | 20 | — |
| Notes: As Weapon Blanch (Adamantine), above. |
| Weapon Blanch, Silver | — | — | — | — | — | 1/2 | 5 | — |
| Notes: As Weapon Blanch (Adamantine), above. |
