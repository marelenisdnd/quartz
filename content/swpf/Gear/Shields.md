Shields add to a character’s Parry as long as the defender is aware of the attack. Light shields add +1, and medium and large shields add +2. Facing in melee can usually be ignored since a defender can turn to face individual opponents throughout the combat round. If she's attacked by multiple creatures on the same Action Card, however, the shield protects against half the attackers (rounded up; defender's call which ones). Ignore that if the shield bearer has a superior position, such as flanked by allies with no foes behind them, blocking a doorway, corner, or narrow hallway, and so on. If using miniatures, remember that they're static but characters in the game world aren't.
A shield's Parry bonus is written in parentheses next to a character’s Parry, like this: 8 (2). This means 2 points of the character’s 8 Parry comes from a shield. Half of the foes who attack this character on the same Action Card can bypass those 2 points but not the other 6.
Cover subtracts from ranged attacks from the front and shielded side (attacks from the rear or unprotected side ignore cover). Unless stated otherwise, shields are Hardness 10.
While worn, shields can be used to bash for Str+d4 damage.
