LONER (MAJOR)
Raised by pirates, bandits, or other troublemakers unwilling to stick out their necks for you, you are accustomed to operating on your own. The presence of allies can easily become a distraction, and you do your best to keep them out of your space.
This character does not benefit from Gang Up bonuses.
