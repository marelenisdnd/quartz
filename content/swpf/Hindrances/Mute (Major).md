MUTE (MAJOR)
Due to trauma or birth, your character has lost the ability to speak. She can write messages to others when needed, use sign language, or some combination of visual communication, but can't form or pronounce words.
Vision-based communication may require a Notice roll to perceive correctly (illumination and similar penalties apply).
