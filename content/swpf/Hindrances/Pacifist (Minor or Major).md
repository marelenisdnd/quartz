PACIFIST (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Your hero absolutely despises violence. Minor pacifism means the hero fights only when given no other choice and never allows the killing of prisoners or other defenseless victims.
Major Pacifists won’t fight living characters under any circumstances. They may defend themselves, but won’t do anything to permanently harm sapient, living beings. They may use nonlethal methods (see page 136), but only in self-defense or the defense of others.
Note that undeniably evil creatures, undead, demons and the like are fair game even for Major Pacifists.
