SPOOKED (MINOR)
A traumatic experience at a young age with a spirit, undead, or other supernatural entity colors your reactions to such creatures.
Whenever you perceive a Fey, Outsider, or Undead within 10" (20 yards) you must make a Fear check. If the creature innately causes Fear, you suffer an additional âˆ’2 to the Fear check. The character does not need to make an additional Fear check if the creature has Fear.

*When a character becomes Jaded (see Pathfinder for Savage Worlds) against a creature's Fear, it only applies to a specific Fey, Outsiders, or Undead. A character may stop being fearful of his tiefling companion, but still panic when he sees a vrock. This means the more supernatural creatures this character is exposed to, the less he will be affected.*
