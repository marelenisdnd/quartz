YOUNG (MINOR OR MAJOR)
The hero is 12–15 years old (in human years— adjust this for other ancestries). He only has 4 points to adjust attributes instead of 5, and 10 skill points instead of 12. The youth may also have legal restrictions depending on any local customs (can’t drink alcohol, can’t carry a weapon, and so on).
On the plus side, youths draw one extra Benny at the beginning of each game session (this stacks with other Edges such Luck or Great Luck).
Most Young characters should also take the Small Hindrance, but it’s not mandatory.
As a Major Hindrance, the character is Very Young (8 to 11 years old), getting only 3 points for attributes and 10 for skills, along with the Small Hindrance. Very Young heroes draw two extra Bennies at the start of each session.
