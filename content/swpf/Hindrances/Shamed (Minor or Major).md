SHAMED (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Something haunts your adventurer. Maybe the hero failed to keep a Vow. Maybe the character was defeated in an honorable fight and ordered the death of the foe anyway for some greater principle. Maybe the hero isn’t actually cowardly but once ran from a battle and left others to die.
As a Minor Hindrance, the shameful circumstances aren’t generally known— it just haunts him. He might go out of his way, against all reason, not to repeat the mistake. Or he might give in to the same set of circumstances and hate himself for it.
As a Major Hindrance, the ill deed is wellknown — or at least known among those the hero cares about. The other player characters should be told the tale as soon as possible (preferably at character creation). If not, it should be revealed by nonplayer characters at some point, and occasionally used against the hero.
