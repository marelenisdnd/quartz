ELDERLY (MAJOR)
Your adventurer is getting on in years. Reduce Pace by 1 and subtract 1 from running rolls (minimum 1). Elderly characters also suffer a âˆ’1 penalty to Agility, Strength, and Vigor rolls, but not their linked skills.
On the plus side, the wisdom of years grants the hero 5 extra skill points which may be used for any skills linked to Smarts.
