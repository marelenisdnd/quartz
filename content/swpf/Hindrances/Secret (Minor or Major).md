SECRET (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Your hero keeps a secret to protect himself or others. As a Minor Hindrance, the secret is troublesome or embarrassing but not life-threatening.
The Major version would cause severe problems if discovered. If it ever becomes public knowledge, he should trade this Hindrance for Enemy, Shamed, Wanted, or another appropriate Hindrance approved by the GM.
