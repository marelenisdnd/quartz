VENGEFUL (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Payback is…well…bad news for someone, and this adventurer is going to get it. 
As a Minor Hindrance, the hero usually seeks vengeance legally. The method varies by situation. Some plot and scheme for months while others demand immediate results. 
Those with the Major version of this Hindrance won’t let anything prevent them from a reckoning. This doesn’t mean they immediately resort to violence, but their actions always escalate until total and complete satisfaction is achieved.
