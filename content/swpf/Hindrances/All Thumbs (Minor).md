ALL THUMBS (MINOR)
Due to upbringing, lack of exposure, or pure bad luck, some individuals are “all thumbs” when it comes to mechanical or technological devices. All Thumbs inflicts a −2 penalty when using mechanical or electrical devices. If the hero rolls a Critical Failure while using such a device (and it doesn’t already have a built-in effect), it’s broken. If the GM feels it’s appropriate, it can be fixed with a Repair roll and 1d6 hours of work.
