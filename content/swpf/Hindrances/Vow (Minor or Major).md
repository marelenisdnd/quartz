VOW (MINOR OR MAJOR)
The character has sworn an oath to someone or something they believe in.
The danger in fulfilling the Vow and how often it might occur determines the level of the Hindrance. A Minor Vow might be to serve an order with a broad mandate that rarely conflicts with the party’s goals.  
A Major Vow makes long-term and frequent demands on the servant’s time and results in great risks to his life.
