PHOBIA (MINOR OR MAJOR)
Phobias are overwhelming and irrational fears that plague a hero’s psyche. Whenever a character is in the presence of the phobia (GM’s call, but generally sight), subtract 1 from all Trait rolls for a Minor Hindrance and 2 for a Major. 
Phobias shouldn’t be too obvious; everyone should be afraid of vampires, for example, so it’s not a phobia, it’s common sense. Instead, the phobia usually centers on some random element the mind associates with the event. Remember, phobias are irrational fears.
