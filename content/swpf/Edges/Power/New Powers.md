# NEW POWERS
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Arcane Background (Any)
An arcane character may learn two new powers by choosing this Edge (which may be taken multiple times). He may choose from any powers of his Rank or lower normally available to his particular Arcane Background.
A character can add a new Trapping on a power she already has instead of gaining a new one. She might add an ice Trapping to her existing fire bolt, for example, so she could switch between ice and fire Trappings freely.
If a wizard takes this Edge, he may choose to learn two powers, as usual, plus a bonus third power, if he has discovered one contained in spellbooks or scrolls he has acquired. The wizard transcribes all three new powers into his spellbook and the original scrolls or spellbooks from which he gleaned his knowledge are added to his repository of notes and research in case he has to make a replacement spellbook in the future.
