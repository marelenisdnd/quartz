# ARTIFICER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (Any)
Those who tangle with supernatural forces sometimes find ways to imbue powers into items. They may turn an ordinary blade into a magic sword, grant powerful potions to their friends, or even bless holy relics with divine grace.
Artificers can create Arcane Devices and give them to their allies. See page 172. Where possible, the device reflects the forger’s background. A bard’s Arcane Devices are works of art, such as a singing sword, a magical instrument, an epic poem, etc.
