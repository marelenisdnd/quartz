# FOLLOWERS
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary
Each time this Edge is chosen, five followers come to fight by the hero’s side. If any are lost, others eventually take their place (how long is up to the GM and the circumstances).
Followers must be cared for and generally want a share of whatever loot, treasure, or other rewards the hero acquires. Otherwise, they are completely dedicated to their task. They won’t throw their lives away but are willing to risk them repeatedly in his service. Use the Soldier profile found on page 144 for the followers. A hero may outfit her allies as she sees fit. Use the Allies rules on page 143 to give them distinctive personalities if desired.
