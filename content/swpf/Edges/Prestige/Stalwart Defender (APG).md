# STALWART DEFENDER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Nerves of Steel, may not have an Armor Restriction or Armor Interference
Drawn from the ranks of guards, knights, mercenaries, and thugs alike, stalwart defenders are masters of claiming and holding an area. This behavior is more than a tactical decision for stalwart defenders; it’s an obsessive, stubborn expression of the need to be undefeated. When such individuals set themselves in a defensive stance, they place their whole effort into weathering whatever foe, conflict, or threat comes their way.
 DEFENSIVE STANCE: Once per encounter, as a limited free action, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trance-like determination for five rounds.
While doing so, the stalwart defender gains +1 Parry and increases his Strength and Vigor one die type but reduces his Pace by 2 and cannot run. He cannot willingly move faster through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If the stalwart defender moves faster than his reduced Pace, his stance ends. The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action.
If the champion enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves.
Ending the stance causes a level of Fatigue. A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and may not be used by a character in a rage (such as from the Barbarian Edge).

# STALWART DEFENDER II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Stalwart Defender
 LAST WORD: Once per day, while in a defensive stance, if an attack Incapacitates the stalwart defender, he may make one melee attack (ignoring Wound penalties) against an opponent within Reach. He treats this attack as if he had been dealt a Joker. Once the attack is resolved, he is Incapacitated as usual.

# STALWART DEFENDER III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Stalwart Defender II
 BULWARK: The stalwart defender becomes a master at reducing the capabilities of his aggressors while in his defensive stance.
While in a defensive stance, Trait rolls targeting him get no benefit from a raise other than the additional damage. For example, an enemy who Taunts the defender and gets a raise still causes him to become Distracted or Vulnerable, but does not cause him to be Shaken.
