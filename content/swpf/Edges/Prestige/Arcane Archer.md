# ARCANE ARCHER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (Any) or Mystic Powers (Any), Shooting d8+
An arcane archer uses magical energies to amplify his arrows or bolts. He may automatically grant one "quality" into any arrow he fires (designated per shot).
The first two qualities an archer learns are:
**Enhance:** The archer's arrow adds +1 to Shooting and damage.
**Trapping:** The arrow has an environmental Trapping such as fire, cold, darkness, etc.

# ARCANE ARCHER II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Arcane Archer
The archer gains two new qualities:
**Phase Arrow:** Once per encounter, the archer may fire an arrow directly through any non-magical barriers, ignoring penalties for Cover or Concealment.
**Hail of Arrows:** Once per encounter, the archer may enchant an arrow so it splits into many when fired, raining down in a Large Blast Template. Everyone inside the template is subject to the attack rollâ€”roll damage separately.

# ARCANE ARCHER III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Arcane Archer II
The archer gains two new qualities:
**Imbue:** Once per turn, the archer can imbue any area effect power into an arrow, "casting" the spell with Shooting and using his bow's Range in place of the power's Range. The spell's area of effect is centered where the arrow lands, even if it must normally be on the caster. If the arrow misses, the spell fails. Imbued spells can't be Shorted or use the Range modifier.
**Death Arrow:** Once per day, the archer can fire a fearsome arrow thrumming with deadly energy. A target Shaken or Wounded by the arrow must make a Vigor roll or die! Death arrows have no effect on constructs or undead.
