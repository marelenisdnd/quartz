# MASTER CHYMIST
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Alchemist
**MUTAGENIC FORM:** A master chymist’s mutagenic form is a dramatically different alter ego caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist’s normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner.
The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different species or gender than her normal form. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego’s limited time in existence often makes this difficult).
**MUTATE:** Once per encounter as a free action, the master chymist may take on a mutagenic form, gaining the effects of one of her mutagens (without expending Power Points). She has only one mutagenic form, no matter which mutagen effect she gains. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new modifiers, penalties, and Duration overriding the previous one). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its Duration expires or she takes another Mutagen or uses her mutate ability again.
**Night Vision:** The chymist gains Nightvision in her mutagenic form.

# MASTER CHYMIST II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Master Chymist
**BRUTALITY:** A master chymist’s taste for violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons easily mastered by her bestial mind. In her mutagenic form, the chymist's Fighting attacks deal +2 damage.

# MASTER CHYMIST III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Master Chymist II
**ADVANCED MUTAGEN:** The mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop. She selects an advanced mutagen that changes how her form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form.
**Furious Mutagen:** The damage dice for the feral mutagen’s bite and claw attacks increase by one die type and gain AP 2. The character must have the feral mutagen Discovery to select this ability.
**Growth Mutagen:** The chymist's mutagenic form is Size +1 and increases Strength one die type.
**Restoring Change:** When the chymist assumes a mutagenic form or returns to her normal form, she may make a natural healing roll.
