# ASSASSIN
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Sneak Attack ability
Those with this Edge are adept at infiltration and cold, efficient murder. They consider themselves artisans, and their medium is death.
**Death Attack:** If the assassin strikes a living victim with the Drop and causes at least one Wound (after any Soaking), the foe must make a Vigor roll or die. If the assassin Incapacitates or slays a victim he had the Drop on, the victim drops quietly and without a sound. It may even be a few moments before those nearby notice the situation, depending on the circumstances.

# ASSASSIN II
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Assassin
**Hide in Plain Sight:** The assassin may magically hide in plain sight. Treat this as invisibility (−4), as long as the assassin doesn’t move or make noise.
**Resistance to Poison:** The assassin adds +4 to rolls made to resist poison.

# ASSASSIN III
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Assassin II
**Angel of Death:** The slayer gains the mystical ability to charge her attack with lethal death energy. If she chooses to do so, a victim slain by her hand crumbles to dust and cannot be resurrected. She may do this no more than once per day.
**Swift Death:** Once per day, as a free action, an assassin gains the Drop over a foe of her choice, even if the target is completely aware of her presence.
