# ARCANE TRICKSTER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Background (Any) or Mystic Powers (Any), Sneak Attack ability, Thievery d8+
These prodigious thieves blend subtle aspects of the arcane with the cunning of sleight of hand and misdirection.
**Ranged Legerdemain:** The trickster can use his Thievery at a Range of 5” (10 yards) or less at a −2 penalty. Any object manipulated at range must weigh less than 5 pounds. Impromptu Attack: Once per encounter, the trickster may use her Sneak Attack ability even if a foe isn’t Vulnerable or subject to the Drop.

# ARCANE TRICKSTER II
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Arcane Trickster
**Invisible Thief:** Once per day, as a free action, the character may cast invisibility for a base cost of 1 Power Point. No arcane skill roll is required, and it's cast as if with a raise. The trickster may use other Power Modifiers or maintain the spell with her own Power Points as usual.
This Edge doesn't grant the trickster the invisibility spell; she must have it on her own.

# ARCANE TRICKSTER III
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Arcane Trickster II
**Surprise Spells:** The trickster’s attack spells benefit from her Sneak Attack ability.
