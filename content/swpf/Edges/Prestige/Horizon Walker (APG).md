# HORIZON WALKER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Survival d6+
Horizon walkers are masters of travel, always seeking to find safe paths through inhospitable terrain. They are comfortable in places others speak of only in hushed whispers, and can venture forth onto untrod paths to guide the less-traveled through such hazardous lands.
A horizon walker gains the Favored Terrain ability (see the Ranger Class Edge). Additionally, the character can select the new terrains from those listed under Terrain Dominance.
**TERRAIN MASTERY:** When within a horizon walker's Favored Terrain, he may, as a limited free action, grant all allies who can see and hear him and are within 5" (10 yards) a free reroll on their next Athletics, Notice, Stealth, or Survival check.
