# MASTER SPY
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Notice d6, Persuasion d8, Performance d6
Unparalleled practitioners of deception, master spies rely on deceit and trickery over brawn and spells. A master spy is an expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection, and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation.
 MASTER OF DISGUISE: A master spy can create a disguise in less than a minute if she has access to a disguise kit or some basic supplies. She reduces any penalties that might come from assuming the persona of a person of different gender, ancestry, age, or size by 2. Additionally, she can cast minor conceal arcana on herself or her equipment as a limited free action. This costs no Power Points and lapses only when she decides to drop it or is sleeping or unconscious.

# MASTER SPY II
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Master Spy
 SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE: A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. She can ignore up to 2 points of penalties when making Smarts-based skill checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity.

# MASTER SPY III
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Master Spy II
 ASSUMPTION: As a limited action, the spy can touch a creature and copy its aura. A spy using this ability cannot have her mind read and any powers used to identify or find her, fail. A power used to search for her assumed identity finds two different targets. For example, someone using locate to find her would fail—they would need to locate the subject of the aura she assumed and even then, he would detect two targets. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (an action) or she uses the ability on another creature.
This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings (GM's call).
