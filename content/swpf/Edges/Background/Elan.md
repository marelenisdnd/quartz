ELAN
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d8+
Elan means energy or spirit. Those who have it rise to the occasion when the going gets toughest. When you spend a Benny to reroll a Trait, add +2 to the total. The bonus applies only when rerolling. It doesn’t apply to damage rolls (since they’re not Trait rolls), nor does it apply to Soak rolls unless you’re using another Benny to reroll the Vigor check.
