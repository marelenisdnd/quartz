LUCKY HALFLING
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Halfling, Common Bond
Some halflings are capable of extending their luck to their companions. Because of this, many adventuring groups consider it good luck to have a halfling counted among their ranks.
This character can spend a Benny to allow an ally to reroll a Trait or damage roll with a +2. This edge does not stack with similar Edges (such as Elan).
