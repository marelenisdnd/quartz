CELESTIAL SERVANT
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Aasimar, Beast Master or similar ability
Rather than being a normal animal or beast, your companion or familiar hails from the heavenly realms.
This character's animal companion's type becomes Magical Beast (though it still counts as an Animal for purposes of spells and abilities) and it gains the following abilities:
 - Armor +2 (this stacks with the companion's existing armor).
 - Night Vision.
 - Smite Evil (as the Paladin Edge) using the aasimar's Rank.
