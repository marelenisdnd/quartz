ARCANE RESISTANCE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d8+
Magic and the supernatural hold little sway with this individual. Whether by nature, heritage, or training the character is particularly resistant to magic and other supernatural energies.


Enemy arcane abilities targeting the hero suffer a âˆ’2 penalty and magical damage is reduced by 2 as well. This includes magical bonuses granted to weapons, such as the smite power or the Damaging enchantment (page 211).

IMPROVED ARCANE RESISTANCE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Arcane Resistance
As above, but the penalty to the arcane skill roll and damage are increased to 4.
