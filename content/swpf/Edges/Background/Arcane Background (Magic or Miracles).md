ARCANE BACKGROUND (MAGIC OR MIRACLES)
REQUIREMENTS: Novice
Exposure to strange energies, studies at a magical school, or gifts from divine or spiritual entities sometimes grant champions their own powers and abilities.
If you want to play a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard based on the original Pathfinder game system's character classes, see the Class Edges beginning on page 43. If you want to make your own custom mage or priest, use the rules here:
**Arcane Background (Magic):** Mages use Spellcasting as their arcane skill, and have Armor Interference (Light) (meaning they subtract 4 from their Spellcasting rolls and from their agility and agility-based skill rolls if using medium or heavy armor or shields). On taking this Edge, you get three starting powers and 10 Power Points.
A mage’s available powers are: *Arcane protection, baleful polymorph, banish, barrier, beast friend, blast, blind, bolt, boost/lower Trait, burrow, burst, confusion, conjure item, curse, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/ conceal arcana, disguise, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation, empathy, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fear, fly, growth/shrink, havoc, illusion, intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness, locate, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, object reading, plane shift, protection, puppet, relief, scrying, shape change, sloth/speed, slumber, smite, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, telekinesis, teleport, time stop, wall walker, warrior’s gift, wish, zombie.*
**Arcane Background (Miracles):** Priests use Faith as their arcane skill and must choose a Domain (see page 50). When they take this Edge, they get 10 Power Points, any three powers listed under the cleric's available powers list or their Domain. They also gain Vow (Major) to serve their deity.
