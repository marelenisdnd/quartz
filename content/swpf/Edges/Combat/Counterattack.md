# COUNTERATTACK
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Fighting d8+
Fighters with this Edge deal instant punishment for an enemyâ€™s mistakes. Once per round (if not Shaken or Stunned), the character receives a Free Attack (page 133) against one failed Fighting attack against him.
The counterattack takes place immediately (before other hits against the hero on the same Action Card, if any).

# IMPROVED COUNTERATTACK
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Counterattack
As above but the hero gets a Free Attack against up to three failed attacks each round.
