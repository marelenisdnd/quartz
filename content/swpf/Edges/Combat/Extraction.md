# EXTRACTION
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d8+
When a character withdraws from melee, adjacent attackers get a free Fighting attack against him (see Withdrawing from Melee on page 141). This is a very dangerous proposition for most, but not your wily champion. When moving away from adjacent foes, one of them (player’s choice), doesn’t get his free Fighting attack.

# IMPROVED EXTRACTION
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Extraction
Up to three foes’ (player’s choice) don’t get attacks when your warrior moves out of melee with them.
