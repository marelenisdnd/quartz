# TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d8+
If a character makes an attack with one action and another from a different hand in a later action, the second attack doesn’t inflict a Multi-Action penalty. The Off- Hand penalty still applies unless he’s Ambidextrous, however (page 94).
The character can choose to make a Fighting or Shooting attack with each hand, an Athletics (throwing) attack with each hand, or a combination of these, depending on the readied weapons.
Example: A fighter wields a longsword in one hand and a dagger in the other. He has Two-Weapon Fighting so he rolls Fighting on one action with the sword, and then makes a second Fighting roll—or an Athletics (throwing) roll— with the dagger, with no Multi-Action penalty to either.
