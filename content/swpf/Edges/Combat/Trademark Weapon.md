# TRADEMARK WEAPON
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, skill with chosen weapon of d8+
The hero knows one unique weapon (Excalibur, Old Betsy, Sting) like the back of his hand. When using it, he adds +1 to his Athletics (throwing), Fighting, or Shooting rolls, and +1 to Parry when readied (even if it’s a ranged weapon).
A fighter can take this Edge multiple times, applying it to a different weapon each time. If a Trademark Weapon is lost, he can replace it but the benefits don’t kick in for a few days (however long the GM feels is dramatically appropriate).

# IMPROVED TRADEMARK WEAPON
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Trademark Weapon
As above but the bonuses when using the weapon increase to +2.
