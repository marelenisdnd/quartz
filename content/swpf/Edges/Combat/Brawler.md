# BRAWLER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d8+, Vigor d8+
His fists hit like hammers or his talons cut like scythes. His body feels like it’s made of stone. Brawlers increase their Toughness by 1 and roll Strength +d4 when hitting with their fists or feet (or claws if they have them). If they already have a damage die from Claws (page 240), the monk’s Unarmed Strike ability, etc., increase the damage die type by one instead. 
The Brawler Edge doesn’t make the character’s fists Natural Weapons (page 136).

# BRUISER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Brawler
The fighter increases his Toughness an additional +1, and the damage caused with his fists or claws another die type.
