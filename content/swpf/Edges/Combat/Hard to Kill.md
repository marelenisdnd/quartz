# HARD TO KILL
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d8+
This adventurer has more lives than a herd of cats. He may ignore his Wound penalties when making Vigor rolls to avoid Bleeding Out (see page 126).

# HARDER TO KILL
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Hard to Kill
If your Pathfinder is ever “killed,” roll a die. On an odd result, he’s dead as usual. On an even roll, he’s Incapacitated but somehow escapes death. He may be captured, stripped of all his belongings, or mistakenly left for dead, but he somehow survives.
