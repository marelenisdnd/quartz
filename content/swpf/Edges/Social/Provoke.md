# PROVOKE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Taunt d6+
Clever characters can manipulate their foes, drawing enemy focus on themselves to protect their allies. Once per turn, when your hero uses Taunt for a Test and gets a raise (see Test, page 140), she may Provoke the foe. In addition to all the usual effects of the success and raise, the enemy suffers a âˆ’2 penalty to affect any other target besides the one who provoked her. This stacks with Distracted but not further instances of Provoke.
Provoke lasts until a Joker is drawn, someone else Provokes the target, or the encounter ends. Provoke may be combined with Rabble Rouser (see below).
