CONNECTIONS
REQUIREMENTS: Novice
Your heroine is connected to people or organizations who can help her when the chips are down. It might be the city guard, a guild, a wealthy noblewoman, or even other adventurers.
Connections may be taken more than once, selecting a new faction or contact each time. Once per session, and assuming she can get in touch with them, the heroine can call on her friends for a favor.
The favor depends on the nature of the contact (GM’s call), but might include a loan, gear, a few allied fighters, transportation, information, or even a professional with critical skills the party doesn’t have, like a tracker or scholar.
