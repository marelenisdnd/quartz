THIEF
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d8+, Stealth d6+, Thievery d6+
Thieves specialize in deceit, treachery, and acrobatics. They can be invaluable where traps must be detected, walls must be climbed, and locks must be picked.
Thieves know how to use the slimmest protrusions on walls and window ledges to climb the tallest of buildings, scampering through streets and back alleys like cats. They add +1 to Athletics rolls made to climb in urban areas.
Thieves also know how to use the dark areas between the streetlights of cities to conceal their movements, and add +1 to Stealth rolls when in an urban environment.
Finally, these rogues are—not surprisingly— adept at Thievery itself, adding +1 to those rolls in all circumstances.
