# BORN IN THE SADDLE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d8+, Riding d6+
Whether it’s on the back of fast horse or other more exotic mount, this hero feels more at home in the saddle than on her own two feet.
The Edge grants the hero one free reroll on all Riding rolls and increases her mount’s Pace by 2 and its running die one step.
