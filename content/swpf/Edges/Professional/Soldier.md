# SOLDIER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Vigor d6+
Professional soldiers get used to carrying heavy loads and enduring harsh conditions. After a few days getting used to their gear (GMâ€™s call), they treat their Strength as one die type higher when determining Encumbrance (page 104) and Minimum Strength to use armor, weapons, and equipment without a penalty (page 83). (This stacks with the Brawny Edge.) They also get a free reroll on Vigor rolls made to survive environmental hazards (see Hazards, page 151).
This Edge has no effect on Armor Interference or Armor Restriction.
