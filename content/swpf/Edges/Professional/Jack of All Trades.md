# JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d10+
Through advanced schooling, book-learning, or just amazing intuitive perception, your hero has a talent for picking up skills on the fly. There’s little she can’t figure out given a little time and a dash of luck.
The character makes a Smarts roll as an action after observing or studying some subject. She gains a d4 in the relevant skill with success, or d6 with a raise. She may try again after an hour of study, trial and effort, or immersion if she fails or wants to try for a raise. This lasts until the character attempts to learn a different subject, whether she’s successful or not.
