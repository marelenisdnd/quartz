# DUCK AND COVER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice
Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.
Whenever this hero and at least one ally must make an Evasion roll (and as long as one or both don't roll a Critical Failure), both characters use the highest total rolled between them.
This hero must select the ally before either of them roll.
