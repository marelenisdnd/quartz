# ROGUE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d6+, Notice d6+, Stealth d6+
Life is an endless adventure for those who live by their wits. Ever just one step ahead of danger, rogues bank on their cunning, skill, and charm to bend fate to their favor. Never knowing what to expect, they tend to prepare for everything. Out of necessity, they become adept manipulators, agile acrobats, or shadowy stalkers. They are thieves and gamblers, fast talkers and diplomats, bandits and bounty hunters, or explorers and investigators.
Although many rogues favor the opportunities of towns and cities, some embrace life on the road. They wander from place to place, meeting exotic people and facing fantastic danger in pursuit of endless riches. In the end, all rogues desire to shape their fates and live life on their own terms.
 - **ARMOR RESTRICTION (Light):** Rogues are nimble and deadly acrobats. Bulky armor interferes with their abilities, so they subtract 4 from Agility and Agility-based skill rolls when wearing medium or heavy armor, or using medium or heavy shields.
 - **SNEAK ATTACK:** Rogues add an additional d6 to their damage when they have the Drop on their victim, or the victim is Vulnerable. This applies to Athletics (throwing), Fighting, or Shooting attacks.

# TRAP SENSE
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Rogue
Rogues are adept at spotting and defeating all but the most clever snares and traps. They get a Notice roll anytime a detectable trap is about to be sprung within 5” (10 yards). They must have line of sight to the trap and can’t be Shaken or Stunned. This works generally like Danger Sense but applies only to mechanical and magical traps.
Traps are fully described on page 156. If the trap is detected and may be Evaded, the rogue and anyone she warns ignores 2 points of Evasion penalties to do so. If the trap can’t normally be Evaded, anyone warned may Evade at the usual −2 penalty.
Disarming Traps: Rogues with Trap Sense ignore up 2 points of Thievery penalties when attempting to disarm traps.

# MYSTIC POWERS (ROGUE) (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Rogue
As a limited free action the rogue can cast one of the following spells: boost Trait (Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery only), darksight, sound/silence, and wall walker. All powers except sound are self only, but the rogue gains no benefit from the Limitation.
The scoundrel has 10 dedicated Power Points that recharge normally. She automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost, or with a raise for an additional two Power Points. She may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired at the usual cost. See Pathfinder for Savage Worlds for more information on specific spells.
Mystic Powers doesn’t grant access to Edges requiring an Arcane Background. If the rogue also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges and abilities can be used with Mystic Powers (and vice-versa).

# UNCANNY REFLEXES
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Rogue
The rogue has an uncanny ability to avoid area attacks and effects. She ignores the usual −2 Agility penalty when making Evasion attempts (see page 132). She also gets a regular Evasion attempt against area effect attacks or effects that don’t usually allow it (at the usual −2 penalty) such as burst or blast, or even confusion or similar spells cast with the Area Effect modifier.

# OPPORTUNIST
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Rogue
When a target Withdraws from Melee with the rogue (see page 141), she gets a free attack even if the foe has Extraction or Improved Extraction. If the foe doesn’t have either of those Edges, he counts as Vulnerable to her for the free attack.

# MASTER STRIKE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Rogue Edges
The rogue is incredibly deadly when using her sneak attack. Each time an attack causes at least one Wound, the rogue may declare one of the effects below, which occurs immediately unless the victim succeeds at a Vigor roll.
• Put the victim to sleep for 1d4 hours
• Paralyze the victim
• Slay the victim
