# ORACLE
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d6+
None of a god's agents are more mysterious than the oracle. These vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers they don't fully understand.
Unlike a cleric, who draws her energies through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, including multiple patron deities who support their ideals. Oracles serve them all, venerating all the gods that grant her power and give her purpose.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Oracle):** Oracles use Faith as their arcane skill. They have 15 Power Points and choose two powers from the list below.
**Available Powers:** Banish, barrier, beast friend, boost/lower Trait, burrow, burst, conjure item, create pit, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, dispel, divination, elemental manipulation, empathy, environmental protection, fear, havoc, healing, light/darkness, relief, resurrection, sanctuary, shape change, slumber, smite, sound/silence. speak language, stun, summon ally, summon monster, summon planar ally, zombie.
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Medium):** Oracles require rapid, intricate, and unhindered somatic movements. While wearing heavy armor or using heavy shields, the character's Faith rolls suffer a −4 penalty. The hero cannot use other abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.
 - **CURSE:** The oracle gains her divine power at the cost of a terrible Curse chosen from the list on page 50. Such is the lot of these enigmatic seers.
 - **MYSTERY:** The oracle selects one Mystery from the list on page 50. This grants her two of the "Available Powers" listed in addition to those she may already have, regardless of her Rank or the power's.
