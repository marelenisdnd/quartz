SUMMONER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d6+, Occult d6+
Summoners form bonds with powerful outsiders from the farthest reaches of the planes. This practitioner of the arcane arts forms a close bond with one particular outsider, known as an eidolon.
Over time, the two become linked, eventually even sharing a shard of the same soul. But this power comes with a price: the summoner’s spells are limited due to his time spent exploring the nature of his eidolon.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Summoner):** Summoners use Spellcasting as their arcane skill. On taking this Edge, the hero gains 10 Power Points, summon ally and one starting power from the list below.
Available Powers: Baleful polymorph, banish, barrier, boost/lower Trait, conjure item, create pit, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, dispel, divination, environmental protection, fly, growth/shrink, healing (summoner and eidolon only), invisibility, light/darkness, magic jar, planar binding, plane shift, puppet, speak language, speed/sloth, summon ally, summon monster, teleport, wall walker.
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Light):** Summoners require rapid, intricate, and unhindered somatic movements. While wearing medium or heavy armor or using medium or heavy shields, the character's Spellcasting rolls suffer a −4 penalty. The hero can't use other abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.
 - **EIDOLON:** The character can summon a powerful outsider known as an eidolon. The mage summons the creature by completing a one minute ritual, and it remains until Incapacitated or dismissed (a free action).
An eidolon returns to its native plane if its summoner is rendered asleep, unconscious, or Incapacitated.
When summoned, the eidolon's Wounds are unchanged from the last time it was dismissed (if slain, it returns with two Wounds).
Summon ally (5 Power Points, no Power Modifiers allowed) may be used to conjure the eidolon faster if needed.

# EXTRA EVOLUTION
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Summoner
The summoner gains additional mastery over his eidolon. This Edge can be taken once per Rank, granting the eidolon 3 Evolution Points (see Eidolon Evolutions, page 55).

# MAKER'S CALL
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Summoner
As a limited free action, a summoner may call a summoned eidolon to his side. The eidolon appears as close to the summoner as possible. Additionally, the summoner and his eidolon can swap locations.

# SUMMONER'S CALL
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Summoner
Whenever the character summons his eidolon, he may increase his eidolon's Agility, Strength, and Vigor one die type. This bonus lasts for 10 minutes after the summoning ritual is complete.

# LIFE BOND
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Summoner
A summoner’s life is linked to his eidolon’s. As long as the creature has at least one Wound remaining, the summoner may transfer any Wounds he'd take to his eidolon instead.

# ASPECT
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Summoner
The summoner may divert up to half the points from his eidolon’s evolution pool to add evolutions to himself (reducing the total number available to the eidolon). He may not select the Attribute Increase, Skill, or Edge evolutions, or any evolution the eidolon can't possess, and he must meet the listed Requirements.
The summoner may change these evolutions any time he can change the eidolon’s evolutions.

# TWIN EIDOLON
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Summoner Edges
The summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. Once per encounter as a limited action, the summoner may assume the shape of his servant, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities. His Strength, Agility, and Vigor change to match his eidolon, but his Smarts and Spirit remain his own.
The summoner may end the transformation as a free action. Otherwise it lasts five rounds, and may be extended it as if it were a power (one additional Power Point every five rounds). The summoner may choose to absorb any gear he carries into the new form. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed. The summoner loses his natural attacks and all ancestral abilities (except bonus Edges, skills, and languages) in favor of his eidolon’s evolutions.
