# PALADIN
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Strength d6+, Spirit d6+, Vow (Minor or Major—serve their deity or order)
Through a worthy few shines the power of the divine. Called paladins, these noble souls dedicate their swords and lives to the battle against evil. Knights, crusaders, and lawbringers, paladins seek not just to spread righteous justice but to embody the teachings of the virtuous deities they serve. In pursuit of their lofty goals, they adhere to ironclad laws of morality and discipline.
As a reward for their service, these holy champions are blessed with boons to aid them in their quests. They gain abilities to battle evil opponents, heal allies, and inspire the faithful. Their conviction leads them into conflict with the very souls they would save. Paladins weather endless challenges of faith and temptation. They risk their lives to do right and ensure justice.
 - **AURA OF COURAGE:** As long as the paladin is conscious, all allies within 10” (20 yards) add +1 to their Fear checks.
 - **CODE OF HONOR:** All good paladins have the Code of Honor Hindrance. They strive to keep their word, won’t kill or abuse prisoners, and generally uphold the highest standards of etiquette and manners. This is in addition to their other Hindrances.
 - **DETECT EVIL:** As an action, the Paladin can concentrate on any one object or individual within Smarts range to determine whether it’s Evil in nature. See page 51 for deities and their alignments.
 - **SMITE EVIL:** As a free action, a paladin can choose an enemy. If that enemy is evil, she gets a free reroll on any failed Athletics (throwing), Fighting, or Shooting rolls against that target for the remainder of the encounter. She may use this ability once per Rank per encounter.

# MYSTIC POWERS (PALADIN)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Paladin
As a limited free action the paladin can invoke one of the following miracles: boost Trait (Fighting, Strength, and Vigor only), healing, relief, and smite. Boost Trait and smite are self only, but the paladin gains no benefit from the Limitation (see page 168).
The paladin has 10 dedicated Power Points that recharge normally (see page 169). She automatically activates the power with success for its regular cost, or with a raise for an additional 2 Power Points. She may use applicable Power Modifiers if desired (at the usual cost). See Chapter 5 for more information on specific spells.
Mystic Powers doesn’t grant access to Edges that require an Arcane Background. If the paladin also has an Arcane Background, none of its Edges or abilities can be used with Mystic Powers (and vice-versa).

# AURA OF JUSTICE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Paladin
As a limited free action the paladin can expend two uses of her Smite Evil ability to grant a single use of the ability to all allies within 5" (10 yards). Allies must use their Smite Evil ability on their next turn or lose the gift.

# MERCY
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Paladin
As an action, a paladin can grant “Mercy” to any character within a Range equal to her Spirit. Mercy removes one of the following: Distracted, Vulnerable, or Shaken.

# MOUNT
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Paladin
The paladin forms a divine bond with a mount she currently owns. This is usually a horse or pony, but may be any mount approved by the GM of Size 3 or less. On forming the bond, the mount gains two advances (Traits or appropriate Edges, GM's call), and is Resilient. It may be summoned as a limited action, arriving at the start of the next round and acting on the paladin's Action Card if in combat. If the mount perishes, the paladin may acquire and bond with another, but may only ever have one bonded mount at a time.

# HOLY CHAMPION (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Paladin Edges
The paladin becomes a conduit for the raw fury of her god. She gains +2 Toughness. Whenever she uses Smite Evil and successfully strikes an Evil Outsider, she can choose to have the target be subject to banish, using the attack roll as the arcane skill total. After the banish and damage from the attack are resolved, the Smite Evil ability immediately ends (even if the foe was not banished).
