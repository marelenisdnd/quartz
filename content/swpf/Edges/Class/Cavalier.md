# CAVALIER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Agility d6+, Fighting d6+, Riding d6+
While many warriors spend their time honing their martial skills, others dedicate themselves to a cause. These "cavaliers" swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else.
They travel about on horseback, championing their causes and charging headlong across battlefields with the symbol of their order trailing on long, fluttering banners.
The cavalier’s true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths he swears, and the challenges he makes to those who stand in his way.
 - **CAVALIER MOUNT:** The cavalier has a special bond with his mount that transcends that of a normal horseman. See page 45 for how the cavalier's mount works.
 - **CHALLENGE:** As a limited action, a cavalier can issue a challenge to an opponent he can see and is within 24" (48 yards). The challenge remains in effect until the target is defeated, the cavalier is Incapacitated, or the combat ends, and he may never challenge more than one enemy at a time. The effects of the challenge can be found under each of the Cavalier Orders beginning on page 44.
 - **MIGHTY CHARGE:** The cavalier increases his melee weapon's damage die one die type on a turn in which he moves towards an enemy while mounted.
 - **ORDER:** A cavalier must pledge himself to an order of like-minded individuals. This gives him a Minor Vow to serve the order that doesn't grant additional Hindrance points. If a cavalier violates his order's edicts (GM's call), he loses the benefits of all Cavalier Edges for 24 hours.
The list of orders, their edicts, and the benefits they grant are listed on page 44. A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations are comprised of cavaliers who all belong to one specific order.

# BANNER
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Cavalier
The cavalier’s banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the warrior’s banner is clearly visible (either held or planted in the ground), all allies within 10" (20 yards) get a free reroll on Fear checks and may reroll their running die once per turn.
As a limited action, the cavalier can wave his banner, removing Distracted and Vulnerable conditions from all allies in Range.

# ORDER ABILITY
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Cavalier
The cavalier's dedication to his order grants him additional strength in combat. He gains the order ability associated with his chosen order (see Cavalier Orders beginning on page 44).

# DEMANDING CHALLENGE
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Cavalier
As long as the cavalier is within 5" (10 yards) of the foe he challenged, he may spend a Benny immediately after the challenged opponent spends one to negate its effect.

# SUPREME CHARGE
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Cavalier Edges
Once per encounter, when the cavalier makes a charge while mounted, he doubles the damage if using a lance.
