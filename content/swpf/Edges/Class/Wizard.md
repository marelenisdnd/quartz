# WIZARD
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d6+, Occult d6+
Beyond the veil of the mundane hide the secrets of absolute power. Mysteries, and wonders of arcane realms call to those with the ambition—and the intellect—to grasp true power. Such is the path of the wizard. These magic-users research, collect, and covet esoteric knowledge. Some choose to become a master of a particular field of magic.
Others embrace versatility, revelling in the unbounded wonders of all magic. In either case, wizards prove a cunning lot, capable of smiting their foes, empowering their allies, and shaping the world to their every desire.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Wizard):** Wizards use Spellcasting as their arcane skill. A hero who takes this Edge gains 10 Power Points and three powers from the list below. Available Powers: Arcane protection, baleful polymorph, banish, barrier, beast friend, blast, blind, bolt, boost/lower Trait, burrow, burst, confusion, conjure item, curse, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation, empathy, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fear, fly, growth/shrink, havoc, illusion, intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness, locate, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, object reading, planar binding, plane shift, protection, puppet, scrying, shape change, sloth/speed, slumber, smite, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, telekinesis, teleport, time stop, wall walker, warrior’s gift, wish, zombie.
 - **ARCANE BOND:** Wizards form an intense magical bond with an object or creature. See Arcane Bond, below.
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Any):** Like sorcerers, wizards must gesticulate in precise patterns. They subtract 4 from their Spellcasting rolls and from their Agility and Agility-based skill rolls if using light, medium, or heavy armor or shields.
 - **SCHOOL:** A wizard’s studies lead him down one of two paths—the “universalist” who dabbles in all the various “schools” of magic, or a “specialist” who focuses on one school at the expense of some others. Specialists must choose one favored school and two opposition schools from the list on page 174. They gain a free reroll on arcane skill rolls to cast spells (not activating an item) from their favored school, but spells cast from their opposition school cost one additional Power Point and suffer a −2 penalty to the wizard's arcane skill roll. Wizards mark favored spells in their power lists in bold and opposition spells with an asterisk, like this: shape change, banish*.
 - **SPELLBOOKS:** Wizards must keep and maintain spellbooks (see page 70).

ARCANE BOND
Wizards immerse themselves in the study of eldritch lore and arcane theories. During these long hours they form a bond with a dependable item or friendly creature (a “familiar”). Choose one of the following options for your wizard:
 - **BONDED OBJECT:** The spellcaster possesses an amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon that adds +1 to all his Spellcasting totals when worn or in hand. If the object is lost or destroyed, the mage can replace it with a new object worth at least 500 gp.
 - **FAMILIAR:** The mage has a magical pet. See the sidebar on page 70.

# FAVORED POWERS (WIZARD)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Wizard
The wizard has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action, he may ignore up to two points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting arcane protection, deflection, dispel. This Edge doesn’t give him those powers— they must be taken separately.

# FAVORED POWERS (CHOOSE ONE) (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Sorcerer or Wizard
The spellcaster has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action, he may ignore up to 2 points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting any one of the spell sets below. This Edge may be taken multiple times, choosing a different set each time. This Edge doesn’t give him those powers— they must be taken separately.
 - **ABJURER:** Banish, environmental protection, or protection.
 - **CONJURER:** Barrier, create pit, or summon ally.
 - **DIVINER:** Detect arcana, locate, or scrying.
 - **ENCHANTER:** Beast friend, empathy, or mind wipe.
 - **EVOKER:** Blast or burst (choose one), havoc, or stun.
 - **ILLUSIONIST:** Conceal arcana, illusion, or invisibility.
 - **NECROMANCER:** Blind, drain Power Points, or fear.
 - **TRANSMUTER:** Elemental manipulation, shape change, or telekinesis.

# ARCANE MASTERY
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Wizard
True understanding of magical energy comes with practice and experience. Wizards who take this Edge gain access to all their powers’ Epic Power Modifiers (see Powers in Chapter Five).

# ELDRITCH INSPIRATION
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Wizard
Great wizards gather esoteric information in their spellbooks, allowing them to harness magical powers at a whim. Assuming he has his spellbook on his person, the wizard can spend a Benny to cast any power of his Rank or lower. The power may be maintained normally but afterwards is forgotten (the wizard doesn’t add it to his list of powers).

# WELL PREPARED (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Wizard Edges
The wizard may activate a power that can normally be cast as an action as a limited free action. This costs an additional Power Point, but not only allows the wizard to cast a spell each round without incurring a Multi-Action penalty, she may also cast it while Shaken or affected by some other condition that only allows free actions.
