INQUISITOR
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Athletics or Fighting or Shooting d6+, Occult d4+
Grim and determined, inquisitors root out enemies of the faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity are not enough. They are above many of the normal rules and conventions of the churches they serve. They answer directly to their deity and their own sense of justice alone, and are willing to take extreme measures to meet their desperate goals.
 - **ARMOR RESTRICTION (Medium):** While wearing heavy armor or using heavy shields, the hero cannot use any abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.
 - **JUDGMENT:** Once per encounter as a free action, the inquisitor can pronounce judgment on an enemy to gain five Judgment Tokens. A single token may be spent to add +2 to a Trait or damage roll she makes against the judged, or âˆ’2 to one of the foe's Trait or damage rolls. Judgment Tokens may be spent after the roll, and remain in effect if the original total is rerolled.
 - **MONSTER LORE:** Inquisitors get a free reroll on skill rolls when attempting to identify a being's abilities or weaknesses.

# BANE
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Inquisitor
Once per encounter, as a limited free action, an inquisitor may imbue her weapon with righteous judgment. As long as it remains in her hands, it has the bane enchantment for five rounds (+2 AP, increases damage die one type; see Magic Items in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds).

# BRAND
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Inquisitor
As a limited action, the character touches a target's flesh and marks it with a magical brand. The brand can be hidden by clothing but cannot be removed except by the inquisitor or holy person of the same faith. When within 6" (12 yards) of a visible symbol of the faith, it glows with the light of a torch and causes the bearer to be Distracted.

# MYSTIC POWERS (INQUISITOR)
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Inquisitor
The inquisitor may cast one of the following spells as a limited free action: boost Trait (Intimidation, Notice, and Survival only), darksight, detect/conceal arcana, and dispel. Boost Trait, darksight, and detect arcana are self only, but the inquisitor gains no benefit from the Limitation.
She has 10 dedicated Power Points, which work as described under the Mystic Powers (Monk) Edge in Pathfinder for Savage Worlds.

# EXPLOIT WEAKNESS
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Inquisitor
The inquisitor learns to exploit an enemy's flaws, treating her attacks as if they were the proper type to trigger a being's Environmental Weakness, if any.
If the target has Fast Regeneration and takes at least one Wound from the inquisitor, it cannot regenerate for the remainder of this encounter.

# TRUE JUDGMENT
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Inquisitor Edges
The judge may call divine wrath down upon the condemned. An inquisitor may declare True Judgment on someone she's judged as a limited free action. If she spends a Judgment Token on an attack that causes at least one Wound, he must make a Vigor roll or perish. After the attack is resolved, she can choose a new opponent to be the target of her remaining judgment. This does not grant her additional Judgment Tokens.
