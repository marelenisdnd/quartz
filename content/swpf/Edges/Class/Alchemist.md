# ALCHEMIST
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d6+
Whether secreted away in a smoky basement laboratory or gleefully experimenting in a well-respected school of magic, the alchemist is often regarded as being just as unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous as the concoctions he brews. While some creators of alchemical items content themselves with sedentary lives as merchants, providing tindertwigs and smokesticks, the true alchemist answers a deeper calling. Rather than casting spells like a sorcerer or wizard, an alchemist captures arcane essences within strange liquids and extracts, infusing mysterious concoctions with spell-like abilities, combustible energy, and transformative mutagens.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Alchemist):** Alchemists use Alchemy as their arcane skill. This gives them 10 Power Points and two powers from the list below. Available Powers: Arcane protection, boost/ lower Trait, burst, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, environmental protection, fly, growth/shrink, healing, invisibility, intangibility, magic jar, protection, relief, shape change, speak language, speed, wall walker, warrior's gift.
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Light):** While wearing medium or heavy armor or using medium or heavy shields, the character's Alchemy rolls suffer a âˆ’4 penalty. The hero cannot use other abilities granted by this Edge or any Edge that has this Edge as a Requirement.
 - **ALCHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION:** An alchemist can use Alchemy to identify a potion as if using detect arcana.
 - **BOMBS AND MUTAGENS:** Alchemists may create bombs and mutagens with their chemicals and reagents. See [[content/swpf/Class specific rules/Bombs (Alchemist)]] and [[content/swpf/Class specific rules/Mutagens (Alchemist)]].
 - **EXTRACTS:** Potions are permanent magic items such as those listed in the Magic Items chapter of Pathfinder for Savage Worlds. Extracts are temporary concoctions imbued with powers and use the creator's Alchemy skill. They behave like spells, and can be dispelled by effects like dispel. 
Extracts are prepared "off camera," requiring an hour's time, the alchemist's formulae book, and an alchemist's kit. The alchemist doesn't spend any Power Points until he activates the power. Without his formulae book, he may cast as usual but cannot refresh his "supplies" (his Power Points do not recharge).
All of the alchemist's powers except burst and damage field with a Range greater than Touch must take the Touch Limitation (since extracts must be consumed or applied to be used). The Power Point cost is reduced as usual. The templates for burst and damage field (with the Area of Effect modifiers) emanate from the character who imbibed the extract, but the alchemist still makes the arcane skill roll.
