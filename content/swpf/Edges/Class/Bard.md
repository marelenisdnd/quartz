# Bard
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Spirit d6+, Common Knowledge d6+
The bards of Golarion bring epic tales of heroism and tragedy to the people. Many are renowned far and wide for their talents, but few realize how crucial they are to parties of brave adventurers. They bolster their allies in dire circumstances, beguile their enemies, and often battle evil with a sword in one hand and a lute in the other.
Bards cast spells by singing, reciting poetry, or reciting epic tales. They are usually erudite individuals, traveling the land to learn bawdy songs, great histories, and epic legends.
Allies must be able to hear the bard to benefit from his various abilities.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Bard):** Bards use Performance as their arcane skill. They have 3 starting powers and 10 Power Points. Available Powers: *Arcane protection, banish, beast friend, boost/lower Trait, confusion, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, conjure item, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, empathy, fear, healing, illusion, mind link, mind reading, object reading, puppet, sloth/speed, slumber, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, teleport, warrior’s gift.*
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Light)**: Bulky armor interferes with a bard’s grace and dexterity. They subtract 4 from their Performance rolls and from their Agility and Agility based skill rolls if using medium or heavy armor or shields.
 - **SHARP TONGUED:** Bards may use Performance as Taunt to Test a foe. They may also ignore the Repetition advice given under Tests (see page 140), as long as they recite different verses, stanzas, lyrics, etc. Bards may also substitute Performance for Taunt to meet Edge Requirements.

# Inspire Heroics
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Bard
Bards inspire their comrades with epic tales of valor and bravery. Once during any combat encounter (GM’s call), the bard can spend a Benny to gain five Inspiration tokens. This is a limited free action.
For the remainder of the encounter, the bard may give these tokens to anyone within a Range of Smarts except himself. This may be done at any time (as long as the bard is conscious). The recipient must use the token immediately—it cannot be saved.
Each Inspiration token allows a character to reroll a Trait or damage roll. A Trait or damage roll may only benefit from a single Inspiration Token, even if there are multiple bards present. Further rerolls require spending a Benny or a special ability.
Inspiration tokens aren’t Bennies, don’t trigger Edges that use Bennies (such as Elan), and can’t be used as such in any other way such as drawing new Action Cards or Soaking Wounds.

# INSPIRE GREATNESS (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Bard, Inspire Heroics
The bard gains an additional three Inspiration Tokens when he uses Inspire Heroics.

# Countersong
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Bard
The bard and all allies within 5” (10 yards) get a free reroll when opposing enemy spell effects or attempting to recover from them. This includes rolls to recover from any magical effect as blind, lower Trait, or stun. Countersong doesn’t help targets resist or recover from natural effects.

# Dirge of Doom
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Bard
This baleful song builds dread in the bard’s foes. At his discretion, any enemy who spends a Benny to Soak or reroll a Trait or damage roll within 10” (20 yards) and line of sight of the bard subtracts 2 from the final total.

# DEADLY PERFORMANCE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Bard Edges
The bard can use his Performance to Incapacitate a foe from extreme joy or sorrow. Deadly Performance may only be attempted once per encounter. The target must be able to see, hear, and understand the bard and be within 5" (10 yards).
When he decides to unleash his deadly display, he makes a Performance roll opposed by the target's Spirit. If the victim resists, he's Stunned and is immune to any Deadly Performance for the next 24 hours. If the victim loses, he's stricken by the last jest, unearthly song, or heart-breaking ballad and Incapacitated.
