# SORCERER
REQUIREMENTS: Novice, Smarts d6+, Spirit d6+
Scions of magical bloodlines, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess. As they tap into powers few mortals can imagine, these magic-touched souls must learn to harness the power of their birthright. While some seek to control their abilities, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives. Sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering. For them magic is more than a useful tool or a field of study; it is life itself.
 - **ARCANE BACKGROUND (Sorcerer):** Sorcerers use Spellcasting as their arcane skill, but it is linked to Spirit instead of Smarts (if multiclassing as a Smarts-based spellcaster, use the better of the two Attributes). On taking this Edge, the hero gains 15 Power Points and two starting powers from the list below.
**Available Powers:** *Arcane protection, baleful polymorph, banish, barrier, beast friend, blast, blind, bolt, boost/lower Trait, burrow, burst, confusion, conjure item, curse, damage field, darksight, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, dispel, divination, drain Power Points, elemental manipulation, empathy, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fear, fly, growth/shrink, havoc, illusion, intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness, locate, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, object reading, planar binding, plane shift, protection, puppet, scrying, shape change, sloth/speed, slumber, smite, sound/silence, speak language, stun, summon ally, telekinesis, teleport, time stop, wall walker, warrior’s gift, wish, zombie.*
 - **ARMOR INTERFERENCE (Any):** Sorcery requires rapid, intricate, and unhindered somatic movements. Sorcerers subtract 4 from their Spellcasting rolls and from their Agility and Agility-based skill rolls if using light, medium, or heavy armor or shields.
 - **BLOODLINE:** The sorcerer must choose a bloodline (see page 66). Beneath each Bloodline description is also the additional special ability one gains when taking the Advanced Bloodline Edge (see page below).

# FAVORED POWERS (SORCERER)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Sorcerer
The sorcerer has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action she may ignore up to two points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting bolt, elemental manipulation, or protection.
This Edge doesn’t give her those powers— they must be taken separately.

# FAVORED POWERS (CHOOSE ONE) (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Sorcerer or Wizard
The spellcaster has great familiarity with certain powers and can cast them quickly and easily. As a limited free action, he may ignore up to 2 points of any penalties (Multi-Action, Wounds, Fatigue, etc.) when casting any one of the spell sets below. This Edge may be taken multiple times, choosing a different set each time. This Edge doesn’t give him those powers— they must be taken separately.
 - **ABJURER:** Banish, environmental protection, or protection.
 - **CONJURER:** Barrier, create pit, or summon ally.
 - **DIVINER:** Detect arcana, locate, or scrying.
 - **ENCHANTER:** Beast friend, empathy, or mind wipe.
 - **EVOKER:** Blast or burst (choose one), havoc, or stun.
 - **ILLUSIONIST:** Conceal arcana, illusion, or invisibility.
 - **NECROMANCER:** Blind, drain Power Points, or fear.
 - **TRANSMUTER:** Elemental manipulation, shape change, or telekinesis.

# ARCANE MASTERY
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Sorcerer
True understanding of magical energy comes with practice and experience. Those who take this Edge gain access to all their powers’ Epic Power Modifiers (see Powers in Chapter Five).

# ADVANCED BLOODLINE
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Sorcerer
You gain the additional ability listed for your Bloodline (see page 66).

# CROSSBLOODED (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Heroic, Sorcerer
A crossblooded bloodline combines the powers of two distinct heritages. In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from the conjunction of other, stranger powers.
The sorcerer can select a new bloodline and gains its benefits. In addition, she can take the Advanced Bloodline Edge an additional time.

# UNIQUE BLOODLINE (APG)
REQUIREMENTS: Wild Card, Legendary, at least two Sorcerer Edges
The sorcerer’s blood grows wild and strange, becoming less about her ancestors and more about her own eccentric personality. The sorcerer selects a bloodline she does not already have and gains its benefits and the benefits of its advanced bloodline.
It's possible for a sorcerer with the Crossblooded Edge and Unique Bloodline Edges to have three advanced bloodlines total.
