# TACTICIAN
REQUIREMENTS: Seasoned, Smarts d8+, Command, Battle d6+
The commander has a natural grasp of small unit tactics and can take advantage of rapidly changing situations.
A Tactician is dealt an extra Action Card each round of combat—kept separate from his own cards. At the start of the round, he may discard it or give it to any one allied Extra in Command Range. The player or GM controlling the receiving character can decide whether to accept and replace her current Action Card, or discard it.
**Surprise:** Tacticians don’t get their extra card if Surprised, but they can give it to an ally who’s Surprised if they like!

# MASTER TACTICIAN
REQUIREMENTS: Veteran, Tactician
The Tactician now gets a total of two extra Action Cards to distribute each round.
